<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Every</span> boy likes to build boats. The interest
in boats seems to be born in the race. The
little three-year-old chap is instinctively attracted
by a puddle of water in which to sail
his "boat," which may take the form of a
piece of shingle or common board. Few
men have passed through their boyhood
days without having built boats at some time.</div>

<p>The author was an ardent boat-builder,
and he well remembers how he combed the
Children's Department of the local library
in search of a book that would tell him something
about boats, and especially for information
regarding the construction of
models. He found books on model airplanes,
toys, electricity, radio, and chemistry,
but alas! nothing about model boats. He
vowed then that when he became a man he
would write a book on model boats&mdash;a book
that would contain all the treasured information
he had accumulated during his boat-building
years.</p>

<p>This book is the result of that vow, and
the author earnestly hopes that it will gladden
the heart of every boy who builds and
sails a boat. There are probably few happier
moments in a boy's life than when he
sees his little model steamer proudly make
her way across the park pond, or his little
sail-boat respond to the summer breeze.</p>

<p>The author takes this opportunity to thank
his wife, who acted as his amanuensis in the
preparation of this manuscript.</p>

<h2>BOYS' BOOK<br />
OF MODEL BOATS</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>WHY A BOAT FLOATS</h3>


<div class='cap'>BEFORE taking up the construction of
any of the model power boats described
in this book, it will be well for the
young boat-builder to become acquainted
with such terms as buoyancy, displacement,
center of gravity, etc. Knowledge of these
subjects is more or less necessary if successful
boats are to be made. Aside from this,
they are terms that every boy who claims an
interest in boats should understand.</div>

<p>"How does a steel boat float?" is a question
that many boys ask. The reason they
usually designate a steel boat is probably because
steel is so much heavier than water.
But many things heavier than water can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
made to float if they are in the form of a
boat. Concrete, for instance, is now being
used in ship construction, and this substance,
when reinforced with steel rods, is
very much heavier than water.</p>

<p>Before learning how a boat floats, what is
known as "specific gravity" must be thoroughly
understood. Gravity is a force that
is continuously "pulling" everything toward
the center of the earth. It is gravity that
gives a body "weight." Some substances
are heavier than others; or, to be more correct,
it is said that the specific gravity of one
substance is greater than that of another.
It will be well to keep in mind that specific
gravity merely refers to weight. It is
simply a scientific term. The specific gravity
of a substance is always expressed by a
figure that tells how much heavier any substance
is than water, because water has been
chosen as a standard.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of water is 1. The
specific gravity of gold is 19.26, meaning that
it is about 19<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> times heavier than water.
The specific gravity of a piece of oak is 0.86,
which shows that it is not quite so heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
as water. One cubic foot of water weighs
62.42 pounds. It will be understood that a
cubic foot of gold would weight 19.26 x
62.42, because it is 19.26 times heavier than
water. A cubic foot of oak, however, would
weigh only 54 pounds, because it has been
found that it has a specific gravity of only
0.86 which is less than water.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;"><a name="fig_1" id="fig_1"></a>
<img src="images/i_020.png" width="350" height="303" alt="Fig. 1" title="" />
</div>

<p>A cubic foot of oak (see <a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a>), with a
weight of 54 pounds, will float when placed
in water. The cubic foot of brass (<i>B</i>), however,
will not float, because it weights 8.1
times as much as water. For the present,
then, it can be said that a substance lighter
than water will float in water, but that substances
heavier than water, such as iron,
lead, gold, silver, etc., will not float. If the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
cubic foot of oak (<i>A</i>) were placed in water,
it would sink to the depth shown at <i>C</i>.
When the block sinks into the water, a certain
amount of water will be forced away or
"displaced"; that is, the block in sinking occupies
a space that was previously occupied
or filled with water. The oak block sinks to
within a short distance of the top because the
oak is really just a trifle lighter than water.
If a pine block were placed in the water it
would sink only to the distance shown at <i>D</i>,
since the weight of pine is less than oak, or
only 34.6 pounds per cubic foot. A pine
block will, then, displace only about 34.6
pounds of water, which leaves nearly half of
the block out of the water. Thus, it will be
seen that for a given volume (size) a cubic
foot of wood will sink to a depth corresponding
to its weight. Different kinds of wood
have different weights.</p>

<p>If a cubic foot of brass is placed in water,
it will sink rapidly to the bottom, because the
brass is much heavier than water. How is
it, then, that an iron or concrete ship will
float? If the cubic foot of brass is rolled
or flattened out in a sheet, and formed or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
pressed into the shape of a boat hull, as
shown in <a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>, it will float when placed
upon the surface of the water. Why is it
that brass is caused to float in this way, when
it sank so rapidly in the form of a solid
square?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig_2" id="fig_2"></a>
<img src="images/i_022.png" width="400" height="256" alt="Fig. 2" title="" />
</div>

<p>It will be remembered that the pine and
oak block were caused to float because they
displaced a greater weight of water than
their own weight. This is just what causes
the brass boat-hull to float. If the amount
of water actually displaced by the hull could
be weighed, it would be found that the weight
of the water would be greater than the
weight of the hull. It will be understood
that the space occupied by the brass boat-hull
is far greater than the space occupied by
the block of brass before it was rolled out
and formed into a hull. What is true of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
brass holds true of iron, steel, etc. A block
of steel will not float, because the water it
displaces does not weigh nearly as much as
the block. If this block, however, were
rolled out into a sheet and the sheet formed
into a hollow hull, the hull would float, because
it would displace a volume of water
that would more than total the weight of the
steel in the hull.</p>

<p>In the case of the brass boat-hull, it would
be found that a greater portion of the hull
would remain out of the water. The hull,
then, could be loaded until the top of it came
within a safe distance from the water. As
the load is increased, the hull sinks deeper
and deeper. The capacity of big boats is
reckoned in tons. If a boat had a carrying
capacity of ten tons it would sink to what
is called its "load water-line" (L.W.L.)
when carrying ten tons. As a load or cargo
is removed from a vessel it rises out of the
water.</p>

<p>What if the hull of a boat has a hole in
it? If the hole is below the water-line,
water will leak in and in time completely
fill the inside of the hull, causing the boat to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sink. Also, if too great a load or cargo
were placed in a boat, it would sink. It
must be understood that water leaking into a
boat increases its load, and if it is not stopped
it will cause the boat to sink.</p>

<p>The center of gravity of a boat is a very
important matter. First, attention will be
directed to the meaning of "center of gravity."
If a one-foot ruler is made to balance
(as shown in <a href="#fig_3">Fig. 3</a>) at the six-inch mark,
the point at which it balances will be very
close to the center of gravity. The real center,
however, will be in the middle of the
wood of which the rule is composed. It
should constantly be kept in mind that this
"center of gravity" is a purely imaginary
point.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>. If wires are arranged
in a wooden frame, as shown, the point
where the wires cross will be the center of
gravity if the square formed by the wooden
strips is solid. Every body, no matter what
its shape, has a center of gravity. The center
of gravity is really an imaginary point
in a body, at the center of its mass. Oftentimes
engineers are heard saying that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
center of gravity of a certain object is too
high or too low. <a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a> shows the center of
gravity in a boat. If the center of gravity
in a boat is too high (as illustrated in <a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a>)
the boat is said to be topheavy and unsafe.
When a boat is topheavy or its center
of gravity is too high, the boat is liable to
capsize. In fact, some very serious marine
accidents have been caused by this fault.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="fig_3" id="fig_3"></a><a name="fig_4" id="fig_4"></a><a name="fig_5" id="fig_5"></a><a name="fig_6" id="fig_6"></a>
<img src="images/i_025.png" width="550" height="418" alt="Fig. 4" title="" />
</div>



<p>The center of gravity (or center of
weight) in a boat should be as low as possible.
A boat with a low center of gravity
will be very stable in the water and difficult<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to capsize. This is true of model boats just
as much as it is true of large boats. The
model boat builder must keep the weight of
his boat as near the bottom as possible. For
instance, if a heavy cabin were built on a
frail little hull, the boat would be very unstable
and would probably capsize easily.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE HULL</h3>


<div class='cap'>MODEL boat-hulls are generally made
by one of two methods. One method
is that of cutting the hull from a solid piece
of wood. The other method is commonly
known as the "bread-and-butter" system.
The hull is built up of planks laid on top one
of another with marine glue spread between
them. The last-mentioned method
(which shall hereafter be called the built-up
method) possesses many advantages over the
first.</div>

<p>Cutting a model boat-hull from a solid
piece of wood is by no means a simple or easy
task, especially for beginners. Of course,
after several hulls have been produced in
this fashion, the worker becomes practised in
cutting them out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="fig_7" id="fig_7"></a><a name="fig_8" id="fig_8"></a>
<img src="images/i_028.png" width="550" height="569" alt="Fig. 7" title="" />
</div>



<p>The construction of hulls on the built-up
principle will be described first. For the sake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of convenience, the drawings of the boat-hull
shown in <a href="#fig_7">Figs. 7</a> and <a href="#fig_8">8</a> will be followed out.
Before going further it will be well to understand
drawings of boat-hulls; that is, how to
know the lines of a boat from a drawing.
By the "lines" is meant its shape. Marine
architects employ a regular method in drawing
boat-hulls. <a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a> shows the side of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
boat and half of the deck plan. It will be
seen that this drawing does not tell much
about the real shape of the boat, and if a hull
were to be produced according to the shape
given, the builder would have to use his own
judgment as to the outline of the hull at different
places. For convenience, the boat is
divided into ten sections, represented by the
lines 0 to 10. It will be seen that the shape
of the hull at section 2 will be different from
the shape of the hull at section 8. Again,
section 0 will be much narrower than section
5.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 143px;"><a name="fig_9" id="fig_9"></a>
<img src="images/i_030a.png" width="143" height="300" alt="Fig. 9" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now look at <a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a>. Note the shape of the
cross-section of the hull at the different sections.
For instance, the line at section 1
in <a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a> represents the shape of the hull at
section 1 in <a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a>. It must be remembered,
however, that this is only half of the section,
and that the line 1 in <a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a> would have to
be duplicated by another line to show the
true shape. The cross-section of the boat at
section 0 is shown in <a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>. One half of
the drawing in <a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a> represents the forward
half of the hull, and the other half
represents the stern half of the hull. If the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
shape of the boat at section 10 is desired, the
line 10 in <a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a> could be traced on a piece
of tissue paper. The paper could
then be folded in half and the line
first made traced on the second
half. This would then produce
the section of the boat at point 10.
Thus, by closely examining <a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a>
 the shape of the entire hull can
be seen.</p>


<p>If pieces of wire could be used to form
the lines of the hull at the various sections,
it would appear as shown in <a href="#fig_10">Fig. 10</a> when assembled.</p>

<p>Notice that in <a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a> there is a load water-line,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
which the vessel sinks to when loaded,
and the second and first load water-line,
which the vessel sinks to when only partially
loaded or when carrying no load aside from
its regular necessary equipment. The keel
line of the boat is the line that runs along the
bottom from bow to stern. (The bow of the
boat is the front and the stern the back.)</p>

</div>

<p>Motor-boating and marine magazines
often publish the lines of different boats, and
if the young boat-builder understands how to
read boat drawings he will be able to make
a model of any boat that is so described.</p>

<p>Directions will now be given regarding
the method of producing a boat-hull similar
to the lines shown in <a href="#fig_7">Figs. 7</a> and <a href="#fig_8">8</a>, by the
built-up method of construction.</p>

<p>First, it will be necessary to procure the
lumber. Several clean white pine boards
will be very suitable to work with, and will
not require much skill in handling. Let us
assume that the boat-hull is to measure 22
inches in length, with a depth of 4 inches.
The beam, which is the width of the boat at
its widest point, will be 5 inches. (It will be
well to remember what the term "beam"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
means, since the term will be used constantly
throughout the book.)</p>

<p>On a piece of heavy wrapping-paper
draw the deck plan full size, that is, 22 inches
long by 5 inches at its widest point. Next
cut out along the pencil line with a pair of
shears. Now lay the paper outline on a
plank and mark out the pattern on the wood.
Repeat this process with three more planks.
When this is done, cut out the boards with
a keyhole saw.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;"><a name="fig_11" id="fig_11"></a>
<img src="images/i_032.png" width="380" height="94" alt="Fig. 11" title="" />
</div>

<p>After the boards are cut out mark them
as shown in <a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a>. The space marked
out on the board must be sawed out in two
of the boards, to form the inside of the hull,
if the boat is to carry some form of power,
such as a battery-motor, or steam-engine.
After the lines are marked out, make a hole
with a <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>-inch bit, as shown in <a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12</a>. Insert
the point of the keyhole saw in one of
these holes to start it and cut out the piece.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Treat the second board in the same way.
The third board must have a smaller portion
cut out of the center, owing to the fact that
this board is nearer the bottom of the hull,
where the width of the boat is narrower.
The width of the piece cut out in the third
board should not be more than 2 inches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;"><a name="fig_12" id="fig_12"></a>
<img src="images/i_033.png" width="375" height="125" alt="Fig. 12" title="" />
</div>

<p>When this work is done, a very thin layer
of glue is placed over the boards, and they
are then laid one on top of another. The
boards are then placed in a vise or clamp
and allowed to remain there over night. In
applying the glue, the builder should be careful
not to put too much on the boards. Too
much glue is worse than not enough. It
should be merely a thin film.</p>

<p>After the boards have been glued together
the crude hull will appear, as shown in <a href="#fig_13">Fig. 13</a>
.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a name="fig_13" id="fig_13"></a>
<img src="images/i_034.png" width="350" height="161" alt="Fig. 13" title="" />
</div>

<p>At this point the hull sections from 0 to 10<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
must be marked off. By referring again to
<a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a> it will be seen that the sections 0 to
1 and 9 to 10 are not so far apart as the
other sections. Section 0 is 1 inch from the
bow of the boat and section 1 is 1 inch from
section 0. Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are
all 1 inch apart. Section 9 is 1 inch from 10
and 10 is 1 inch from the stern. Lines
should be drawn across the deck to correspond
with these sections, which can be
measured off with a ruler. It will now be
necessary to cut some templates, or forms,
from cardboard to guide the builder in bringing
the hull to shape. It will be an easy matter
to make these templates by following
<a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a>. A template of section 9 is shown in
<a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14</a>. It will be necessary to make eleven
templates, corresponding to the sections 0 to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
10. The templates should be cut from heavy
cardboard so they will hold their shapes.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a name="fig_14" id="fig_14"></a>
<img src="images/i_035.png" width="300" height="219" alt="Fig. 14" title="" />
</div>

<p>The hull of the boat is now placed in a vise
and roughly brought to shape with a draw-knife.
After it has been brought to shape
by this means a spoke-shave is used. This
little tool has an adjustable blade by means
of which it is possible to regulate the cut.
When the builder starts to use the spoke-shave
he should also start to use his templates
or forms, applying them sectionally to
determine how much more wood he will have
to remove to bring the hull to shape. For
instance, when he is working in the vicinity
of sections 5, 6, and 7 he will apply these
forms at the proper points occasionally to
determine when enough wood has been removed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
This procedure is followed out the
entire length of the boat, care being taken
to see that both sides are the same and that
too much wood is not removed, since there
is no remedy for this mistake. The builder
who proceeds carefully and is not in too great
a hurry to finish the work need not make this
mistake.</p>

<p>Of course, it will not be possible to bring
the hull to a perfect finish with a spoke-shave.
This can be done, however, by the
use of a coarse file and sandpaper. The
coarse file is used to take the rough marks of
the spoke-shave away, and the marks left by
the file are in turn removed by the sandpaper.
The sandpaper must be applied unsparingly
and always with the grain. It will be necessary
to use considerable "elbow grease" to
obtain a good finish.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 375px;"><a name="fig_15" id="fig_15"></a>
<img src="images/i_037.png" width="375" height="315" alt="Fig. 15" title="" />
</div>

<p>Boat-hulls can also be hewn to shape from
a solid block, but it will be understood that
this method involves more work than the one
just described. Of course, the procedure of
bringing the hull to shape by the aid of the
draw-knife, spoke-shave, and templates is
the same, but the hollowing out of the inside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of the hull will be a much more difficult
job. However, with a couple of good sharp
chisels and a gouge the work will not be so
difficult as at first appears. The use of an
auger and bit will greatly aid in the work.
After the outside of the hull is brought to
shape the wooden form is drilled with holes,
as shown in <a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15</a>. This will make it much
easier to chip the wood away. After the
major portion of the wood has been taken out
with the chisel, the gouge is brought into use.
The gouge should be used very carefully,
since it will easily go through the entire hull
if it is not handled properly. For the beginner
it is not safe to make a hull less than
<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch in thickness. Of course, it is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
necessary to carefully finish the inside of the
hull, since it is covered up with the deck and
cabin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;"><a name="fig_16" id="fig_16"></a>
<img src="images/i_038.png" width="325" height="116" alt="Fig. 16" title="" />
</div>

<p>The solid hull has one advantage over the
built-up hull. It is not affected by moisture
and it is therefore not so liable to warp and
lose its shape. It will also stand more rough
usage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="fig_17" id="fig_17"></a><a name="fig_18" id="fig_18"></a><a name="fig_19" id="fig_19"></a>
<img src="images/i_039.png" width="450" height="453" alt="Fig. 17" title="" />
</div>



<p>There is still another method of producing
a boat-hull. This hull is known as the
Sharpie type. A Sharpie hull is shown in
<a href="#fig_16">Fig. 16</a>. The method of producing a hull of
this type will be seen quite clearly by reference
to <a href="#fig_17">Fig. 17</a>, which shows the boards and
parts cut out ready to assemble. The boards
are made from <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch mahogany, which can
be obtained at any lumber-yard. First, the
bow piece is cut to shape and carefully
finished. Then the two side pieces are
fastened to it, as shown in <a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a>. The
screws used should be brass, since iron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
screws will rust and cause trouble. Three
screws should be used for each side board,
and they should be driven into the bow piece
so that the screws on one side will not interfere
with those on the other. The first
cross-piece is then screwed in place, as shown
in <a href="#fig_19">Fig. 19</a>. The second and third cross-pieces
are then screwed in place and the
back or stern piece attached. The bottom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of the boat is then carefully put in place with
small screws. It will be noticed that the
bottom board of the boat is cut to fit the inside
of the bottom. It is held in place with
small brass brads. The crevices or seams
along the bottom of the boat should be carefully
covered with pitch or marine glue to
prevent leakage when the boat is in the
water. The bow of the boat should be finished
off nicely to a point with a heavy file or
a wood-rasp.</p>

<p>This type of hull is extremely easy to produce
and it is capable of carrying a considerable
load. However, it is not a good type to
use for all kinds of boats. It makes a splendid
little pleasure yacht or submarine-chaser,
but for a torpedo-boat destroyer or a freighter
it would not be suitable.</p>

<p>The young model boat builder is advised
not to try to construct hulls from metal.
This is a very difficult task even for the
thoroughly experienced mechanic. Wood
is much easier to work with and will produce
the same results.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>HOW TO MAKE SIMPLE BOATS, WITH AND WITHOUT POWER DRIVE</h3>


<div class='cap'>THIS Chapter will be devoted to the construction
of very simple types of boats.
The boats described will be constructed
largely with blocks of wood cut into various
shapes and sizes. The results obtainable by
this method of construction are surprising,
and there are few types of boats that cannot
be modeled by following the method.
After the model-builder has constructed a
few boats along this principle he will be
able to duplicate the general appearance of
almost any craft he sees by carefully planning
and cutting the blocks he uses.</div>

<p>The first boat described is a submarine.
This is shown in <a href="#fig_20">Fig. 20</a>. Four blocks of
wood form the basis of its construction, and
these are cut from 1-inch stock, as shown in
the drawing. Such a submarine can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
made practically any size up to 12 inches in
length. Beyond this size they begin to look
out of proportion and they are more difficult
to propel. After nailing the blocks together
as shown in the drawing, a small
piece of sheet brass is bent at right angles
and tacked to the stern piece. This is to act
as a bearing for the propeller.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="fig_20" id="fig_20"></a><a name="fig_21" id="fig_21"></a>
<img src="images/i_042.png" width="550" height="547" alt="Fig. 20" title="" />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The propeller-shaft is bent into a hook
over which rubber bands are placed. The
opposite end of the rubber bands are fastened
to a screw-eye driven into the under side of
the bow. A heavy piece of copper wire is
fastened to the stern of the boat by staples,
and bent as shown. A rudder is then cut
from thin sheet brass, and the end of it is
bent around a piece of wire larger in diameter
than the wire used for the rudder-post.
It is then taken from this wire and slipped
over the wire on the boat. It should be
pinched in place by a pair of pliers, so that
it will stay in any position in which it is put.
The end of the wire is bent over so that the
rudder will not slip off. The boat can be
steered in a circle or it can be made to go
straight, depending upon the position of the
propeller.</p>

<p>The horizontal rudders are mounted forward,
as shown. They are made from thin
sheet brass bent as indicated in the little insertion.
A hole is drilled in them as shown,
and a screw is placed through these to hold
the rudders to the side of the craft. The
screws should be tightened so that the rudders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
will stay at any angle at which they
are put. If the boat is to be submerged
the rudders are pointed as shown. If the
boat is to travel on the surface of the water
the rudders are brought up into a horizontal
position or parallel with the deck. A little
gray paint placed on this model will greatly
improve its appearance.</p>

<p>Another submarine, more complicated
than the one just described, is shown in <a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a>
. The body of this submarine is formed
by a part of a broomstick or shovel-handle.
This submarine is truer to type and can be
made with very little trouble. The piece of
broomstick or shovel-handle is cut 22 inches
in length. It is pointed at each end, and
part of it is planed off to form the upper
deck. When this is done, a small flat piece
is cut as shown, and nailed or screwed to the
flat portion. The conning-tower and periscope
are placed on the upper deck, as shown.
The rudder on this craft is not made adjustable,
so that it always travels in a perfectly
straight line. The horizontal rudders however,
are made adjustable, and the boat is
therefore able to travel upon the surface or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
submerge, depending upon the position of the
rudder.</p>

<p>The power plant of this boat is made up of
rubber bands. The power transmission to
the propeller is a little different than the
one previously described. A gear and a
pinion are salvaged from the works of an
old alarm-clock, and mounted on a piece of
brass, as shown. A little soldering will be
necessary here to make a good job. By
using the gear meshing with the pinion a
considerable increase in the speed of the propeller
is obtained, and therefore the speed
of the boat is considerably increased. The
method of holding the power plant to the bottom
of the boat is made very clear. In order
to bring the boat down to the proper level in
the water, a strip of sheet lead can be tacked
to the bottom. The builder should take care
to get a piece of lead just the correct weight
to leave the surface of the deck awash. A
coat of gray paint will also greatly improve
the appearance of this craft.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig_22" id="fig_22"></a><a name="fig_23" id="fig_23"></a><a name="fig_24" id="fig_24"></a>
<img src="images/i_046.png" width="500" height="708" alt="Fig. 22" title="" />
</div>


<p>Attention is directed to the construction
of boats of different types made without
power plants. Many interesting little crafts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
can be produced in this way, and the energetic
model-builder can produce a whole
model harbor or dock-yard by constructing a
number of boats of different types according
to the following instructions.</p>

<p>The first boat described will be the tug
<i>Mary Ann</i> shown in <a href="#fig_22">Fig. 22</a> and <a href="#fig_23">Fig. 23</a>.
The blocks necessary to construct this boat
are shown in <a href="#fig_24">Fig. 24</a>. The hull of the boat
is produced by three pieces of wood sawed
out to the same shape with a keyhole saw
and glued together. After the glue is dry
the blocks are placed in a vise and the top
one or deck block is planed down as shown.
It will be seen that the deck inclines slightly
toward the stern of the boat. When this is
done the hull is turned upside down and the
bottom of the stern planed off as illustrated.
The outside of the hull can be finished up
with a sharp knife and a jack-plane.</p>

<p>The little bow piece can also then be tacked
in place. After this the pieces that form the
hull can be nailed together from the bottom
and from the top. This is quite necessary,
for glue will not hold them in place after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the boat has become thoroughly soaked with
water.</p>

<p>The cabin and engine-room are shown
very clearly in the illustration and little need
be said about erecting this part of the craft.
The two doors and window on the side of the
cabin are made by cutting out small pieces of
cigar-box wood and gluing them to the cabin
and engine-room. A good substitute for the
wood can be found in tin, but of course this
would have to be tacked on. The little skylight
on the back of the tug is made by a
single block covered by two pieces of cigar-box
wood.</p>

<p>In order to stabilize the craft and to bring
her down to the proper water-line, a lead
keel must be nailed to the bottom. The
weight of this keel will have to be adjusted
until the boat rests properly in the water.
The reader will notice that no dimensions
have been given for this boat. This is because
most boys will wish to build different
sized boats, and therefore it has not been
deemed advisable to dimension the boats described
in this Chapter. What the author<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
desires to do is to impart the principles of
construction, so that every boy may use his
own ingenuity in regard to size and proportion
of length to beam.</p>

<p>If tugs are constructed according to the
design outlined above, the model boat builder
will also desire to have something that the
tug can haul. A very simple barge for this
purpose is outlined in <a href="#fig_25">Figs. 25</a> and <a href="#fig_26">26</a>. This
is formed of a single slab with the ends cut
at an angle as illustrated. A square flat
piece is then tacked to the upper deck, which
acts as a cover. Four posts are then put in
place in the same way as those on the tug.
One is placed in each corner. A boat or a
scow like this is generally painted red, and
the model described can be made to look
much more realistic by painting it this color.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="fig_25" id="fig_25"></a><a name="fig_26" id="fig_26"></a><a name="fig_27" id="fig_27"></a><a name="fig_28" id="fig_28"></a>
<img src="images/i_050.png" width="450" height="555" alt="Fig. 25" title="" />
</div>


<p>These barges are so easy to construct that
the model-builder should make three or four
of them at a time. If the pieces for several
are cut out at the same time, the construction
will be just that much easier. If the
boat does not sink far enough into the water,
a piece of lead should be placed on the bottom
to bring it down. This piece of lead should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
be placed as near the center as it is possible
to get it. Otherwise the boat will list or tip
at one end or the other. With a little
patience and care the weight can be so adjusted
on the bottom as to bring the scow to
a perfectly level position. The reader will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
understand that the water-line of a scow or
any boat made according to the directions in
this book will depend largely upon the nature
of the wood. In the first Chapter of
the book it was pointed out that the specific
gravity of different woods varies, and therefore
the buoyancy will vary.</p>

<p>A model freighter is shown in <a href="#fig_27">Fig. 27</a>.
The hull of this boat can be formed by two
1<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>-inch planks. These will require a little
hard work to cut out; but, on the other hand,
the effort will be entirely justified by the
pleasing appearance of the little craft that
can be produced in this way. A bow and
stern block to raise the deck are cut out and
nailed in place, as shown. A cabin is also
placed on the stern of the craft, and this is
formed by a block with a piece of cigar-box
wood placed on the top. The cigar-box
wood should project a little over the edges to
form a canopy. The center of the deck can
be raised by a third block; and three independent
blocks, two large ones and a small
one, form the main cabin. Sandwiched in
between these blocks are three pieces of
cigar-box wood. The remaining details of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the craft are so simple that they may easily
be made by following the diagram.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="fig_29" id="fig_29"></a>
<img src="images/i_052.png" width="450" height="195" alt="Fig. 29" title="" />
</div>

<p>Let us turn our attention to model war-ships.
A torpedo-boat destroyer is clearly
illustrated in <a href="#fig_28">Figs. 28</a> and <a href="#fig_29">29</a>. This is very
simple to construct and makes a pleasing
craft when finished. The hull is formed by
two blocks. One of these forms the raised
deck on the bow of the boat. The cabin is
built up on this raised deck. It will be seen
that the part of the hull that rests in the
water is formed by one block. In building
boats of this nature the constructor should
be careful to keep them long and slender,
since torpedo-boat destroyers are always of
this type. They are high-speed craft, and
their displacement must therefore be as small
as possible. Some of these boats carry four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
stacks and some two. The author prefers
four stacks as giving the boat a better appearance
than two. The two little cabins
near the stern of the boat are placed there
merely to take away the plainness of construction.
The guns mounted forward and
aft are merely round pieces of wood with a
piece of wire bent around them and forced
into a hole in the deck.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="fig_30" id="fig_30"></a>
<img src="images/i_053.png" width="550" height="407" alt="Fig. 30" title="" />
</div>

<p>The boat-builder should not be satisfied
with one or two of these craft; he should
make a whole fleet. This will afford the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
average boy a great amount of pleasure,
since he can add to his fleet from time to
time and have official launchings. Each
boat can also be given a name and a number.
A little gray paint on the hull of these
boats and black on the stacks gives them
a very presentable appearance.</p>

<p>A battleship is shown in <a href="#fig_30">Fig. 30</a>. A battleship
should be at least twice as long as a
torpedo-boat destroyer. A view of the battleship
as it will look in the water is shown
in <a href="#fig_31">Fig. 31</a>. By carefully examining this
drawing the builder will be able to see just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the number and shape of the blocks that
enter into the construction of the craft. The
battleship is provided with four main batteries
mounted in turrets, one forward and
three aft. A mast is also built, and strings
run from it to the top of the main cabin and
to the end of one of the turrets mounted aft.
A screw is placed through the centers of the
fore and aft turrets, so they can be turned to
any position. Battleships should be painted
gray. It will be necessary to place rather
a heavy keel on the boat just described in
order to bring it down to the proper depth
in the water. Otherwise it will be topheavy
and will capsize very easily. A fleet of battleships
and battle-cruisers can easily be
made according to the foregoing instructions,
and the builder should not be satisfied
with producing only one.</p>

<p>A pleasure yacht is illustrated in <a href="#fig_32">Fig. 32</a>.
The hull of this craft is formed by two
boards nailed together. The cabins are very
simple, being formed by a solid block of
wood with a piece of cigar-box wood tacked
to the top. The windows and doors are
marked in place with a soft lead-pencil, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the stack is mounted midway between the
two cabins. A wireless antenna should be
placed on the boat, with a few guy-wires
from the masts run to various parts of the
deck. A lead-in wire also runs down into
one of the cabins. The hull of this boat
should be painted pure white. The deck can
be left its natural color, while the stack
should be painted black and the cabins white
with green trimmings.</p>

<p>Almost any type of boat can be produced
by the use of simple blocks of wood and other
miscellaneous pieces easily brought to shape
from ordinary materials. This method of
construction offers a wonderful opportunity
for the boy to exercise his creative faculties.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>STEAM AND ELECTRIC PROPULSION</h3>


<div class='cap'>BOATS are propelled by two different
systems. Some inland-water boats
still employ side paddle-wheels, while ocean-going
vessels use the more modern propeller
or screw.</div>

<p>The paddle-wheel really acts as a continuous
oar. Such a wheel is shown in <a href="#fig_33">Fig. 33</a>
. As the wheel goes around the paddle
dips into the water and pushes the boat forward.
If the direction of the boat is to be
reversed, the rotation of the paddle-wheels is
reversed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig_34" id="fig_34"></a><a name="fig_33" id="fig_33"></a><a name="fig_35" id="fig_35"></a><a name="fig_36" id="fig_36"></a><a name="fig_37" id="fig_37"></a><a name="fig_38" id="fig_38"></a>
<img src="images/i_058.png" width="500" height="564" alt="Fig. 33" title="" />
</div>


<p>Before passing onto the screw, it may be
well to explain just how a paddle-wheel
causes a boat to move. When a man gets
into a rowboat, he generally pushes himself
off by placing his oar against the dock or
shore and pushing on it. That is just what
the paddle does in the water. It dips into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the water and pushes against it. It must be
remembered, however, that water is unlike
a solid substance and it "gives." When a
man places his oar against the bank and
pushes it, the bank does not move, and all
of the man's energy is used in starting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
boat. Water, however, does not remain stationary
when the paddles push against it,
and therefore all of the power it not utilized
in moving the boat&mdash;part is used in moving
the water.</p>

<p>The paddle-wheel is not so efficient in moving
a boat as the more modern propeller&mdash;or
screw, as it is more often called. The screw
receives its name from the ordinary metal
screw, because its theory of operation is exactly
the same. A wood screw, when
turned, forces itself into wood. A propeller,
when turned, forces itself (and thereby the
boat) through the water. A small propeller
is illustrated in <a href="#fig_34">Fig. 34</a>. This is an ordinary
three-blade propeller. (The writer prefers
the word propeller instead of screw.)</p>

<p>From the drawing, it will be seen that the
propeller-blades are mounted at an angle.
This angle of the blades causes them to force
water back as they cut through it when the
propeller is revolving. This forcing of the
water back tends to produce a forward motion
of the propeller, and in this way the
boat on which the propeller is mounted
moves through the water. The propeller is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
caused to revolve by a steam-engine, steam-turbine,
or gasolene-engine, as shown in <a href="#fig_35">Fig. 35</a>
. Longer boats have more than one propeller.
A boat that has two propellers is
called a twin-screw boat. A boat driven
with four propellers is called a quadruple-screw
boat.</p>

<p>When a machine screw is turned around
just once, it moves forward a certain distance,
as a glance at <a href="#fig_36">Fig. 36</a> will show. The
distance the screw moves forward will depend
entirely upon the distance between the
threads. The distance between the threads
is called the pitch of the thread. If the
threads are <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>32</sub></span> inch apart, then the screw
will move <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>32</sub></span> inch every time it revolves.</p>

<p>If a propeller acts in the same way as a
screw, then it too must have a pitch. The
pitch, or the distance that a propeller will
advance in one revolution, is measured in
inches. A propeller with a pitch of ten
inches should move ten inches through the
water at each revolution. However, there
is a certain amount of "slip," and a propeller
does not actually advance the distance that
it should theoretically. The pitch of a propeller<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
is really the distance it would advance
in one revolution if it were revolving in an
unyielding or solid substance.</p>

<p>To make a simple propeller, first cut out
of thin sheet brass three blades as shown at
<i>A</i>, <a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a>. Sheet brass with a thickness of
<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>32</sub></span> inch is very suitable for this purpose.
Next, a block, as shown at <i>B</i>, is carefully
carved out so that the propeller can be hammered
down into the depression. The same
block is used for the three blades, so that
each will have the same curvature. The
block should be cut from oak, since this wood
will not split or lose its shape when the forming
is done.</p>

<p>The hub is made next. This is shown at
<i>C</i>, <a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a>. The hub, of brass, is made according
to the stream-line method. It is
filed to shape from a piece of round brass
stock. A hole runs lengthwise in the brass,
as shown, and a set-screw is used to hold the
hub of the propeller-shaft. The method of
cutting the slots in the hub is shown at <i>D</i>,
<a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a>. The hub is clamped between two
boards placed in the vise, and a hacksaw is
used to cut a slot in the hub. The hub is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
then turned around one third of a revolution,
and another slot cut, using the same saw-marks
in the boards, so that the angle of the
second slot will be the same as the first one.
The third slot is cut in the same manner.
The three blades that were cut out are now
fastened in these slots and held there by solder.
This completes the propeller and it is
now ready to be fastened upon the propeller-shaft.</p>

<p>Let us consider the general method of
putting the propeller-shaft in place. The
young boat-builder will readily understand
that it would be very impractical merely to
bore a hole in the hull of the boat to put the
propeller-shaft through. In this way water
would surely leak into the hull and the boat
would sink in a short time. Some method
must be evolved to keep the water out of the
hull, and yet allow the propeller-shaft to revolve
freely.</p>

<p>The propeller-shaft is arranged within a
brass tube, as shown at <a href="#fig_38">Fig. 38</a>. The brass
tube should be about <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch larger in diameter
than the propeller-shaft. A little brass
bushing must also be arranged at each end,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
as shown. When the propeller-shaft is
mounted in place in the tube, there will be a
space between it and the tube. Before the
propeller-shaft is put in place it is well
smeared with vaseline, and when it is placed
in the tube the space between the shaft and
the tube will be completely filled with it.
This will prevent water from entering.
Owing to the fact that vaseline is a soft,
greasy substance, it will not prevent the rotation
of the propeller-shaft. The brass
tube is placed through a hole bored in the
hull of the boat. The hole should be a
trifle smaller than the diameter of the
brass tube, so that the tube can be forced
into the hole.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig_39" id="fig_39"></a><a name="fig_40" id="fig_40"></a><a name="fig_42" id="fig_42"></a>
<img src="images/i_064.png" width="500" height="354" alt="Fig. 39" title="" />
</div>


<p>One of the simplest methods of propelling
a boat is by means of rubber bands. Such
a boat is shown in <a href="#fig_39">Fig. 39</a>. This is a small
wooden hull fitted with a two-blade propeller.
The propeller is shown at <a href="#fig_40">Fig. 40</a>. It is cut
in a single piece and held to the propeller-shaft
merely by a drop of solder since there
will not be much strain upon it owing to the
low power of the rubber-band motor. The
opposite end of the propeller-shaft is bent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
into a hook, and the rubber bands run from
this to another hook placed at the bow of the
boat. The rubber bands may be similar to
those employed by model airplane builders.
The motor, of course, must be wound up by
turning the propeller around until the bands
become twisted into little knots, as shown at
<a href="#fig_39">Fig. 39</a>. Boats driven by rubber bands cannot
be very large unless a great number of
rubber bands are used. Even then the
power is short-lived. However, building a
few small boats driven by rubber-band motors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
will do much to teach the young boat-builder
some valuable lessons in boat construction.</p>

<p>Probably the best method of propelling
model boats is the electric method. By
building a boat large enough to accommodate
two dry batteries or a small storage
battery and a little power motor, a very reliable
method of propulsion is made possible.
The boat must have sufficient displacement
to accommodate the weight of the dry-cells
and storage battery. A boat two feet long,
with a beam of 4<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches, is large enough to
accommodate one dry-cell and a small motor,
providing the fittings of the boat are not too
heavy.</p>

<p>A suitable power motor for small boats,
which will run with either one or two dry-cells,
is shown in <a href="#fig_41">Fig. 41</a>. The connections
for the motor are given clearly in <a href="#fig_42">Fig. 42</a>,
and a suitable switch to control the motor
is shown at <a href="#fig_43">Fig. 43</a>.</p>

<p>Owing to its greater power, the storage
battery is to be preferred. Dry-cells are extremely
heavy and occupy considerable
space. They are also costly, since they do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
not last long and cannot be worked too hard
unless they polarize.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="fig_41" id="fig_41"></a><a name="fig_43" id="fig_43"></a><a name="fig_44" id="fig_44"></a><a name="fig_45" id="fig_45"></a>
<img src="images/i_066.png" width="550" height="440" alt="Fig. 41" title="" />
</div>



<p>A very suitable method of mounting an
electric motor is illustrated in <a href="#fig_44">Figs. 44</a> and
<a href="#fig_45">45</a>. It will be noticed that the motor is inverted.
A small pinion or gear is mounted
upon the armature-shaft of the motor. A
larger gear (about three times the diameter
of the small one) is placed upon the propeller-shaft.
This gives a speed reduction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of three to one. It will be seen that the propeller-tube
is strapped within a strip of brass
to a small cross-piece nailed to the bottom
board of the hull. The hull is of the built-up
type, and the other three boards that go
to make it up are not shown. When the
three boards are glued in place, a brass strip
is run across the top board and the base of
the motor is screwed to this. This holds the
motor rigidly in place so that it will not move
when the power is turned on. The brass
strip used should have sufficient thickness to
hold the motor rigid. It will also be seen
that the motor is tipped slightly so that it
will come in line with the propeller-shaft.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="fig_46" id="fig_46"></a><a name="fig_47" id="fig_47"></a><a name="fig_48" id="fig_48"></a>
<img src="images/i_068.png" width="550" height="397" alt="Fig. 46" title="" />
</div>


<p>It is not always possible to obtain small
gears. For this reason the model boat
builder may find it necessary to use a different
method of fastening the propeller-shaft
to the motor. A very good method of doing
this is shown in <a href="#fig_46">Fig. 46</a>. Here a coiled wire
spring is used. This is wound to shape on
a rod, and a drop of solder holds it to the
propeller and motor shafts. In the method
of propulsion shown in <a href="#fig_44">Fig. 44</a> the armature-shaft
of the motor must be perfectly in line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
with the propeller-shaft, or the gears will
bind and unsatisfactory operation of the
motor will result. With the little spring the
motor will not have to be mounted exactly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in line with the shaft, and it will also be possible
to mount the motor standing up. Of
course, if the motor is mounted in this way
it will be necessary to make the propeller-shaft
longer, as is shown in <a href="#fig_47">Fig. 47</a>.</p>

<p>Still another method of driving the propeller
is illustrated in <a href="#fig_48">Fig. 48</a>. This method
is so simple that the author feels explanation
to be unnecessary.</p>

<p>Clockwork can often be employed for propulsion
purposes, but this method is not very
satisfactory. It is also very difficult to obtain
suitable clockworks to install in a boat.
Oftentimes it will be possible to salvage the
works of an old alarm-clock, providing the
main-spring is intact. It is a very easy
matter to mount the clock-spring and connect
it to the propeller. Any one of the
aforementioned methods can be employed.</p>

<p>Steam propulsion has its advantages; but,
on the other hand, the writer is not inclined
to recommend it as strongly as the electric
method for reliability. Of course, steam is
a more powerful agency in the propulsion of
small boats and thereby greater speed is attainable
by its use.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="fig_49" id="fig_49"></a><a name="fig_50" id="fig_50"></a><a name="fig_51" id="fig_51"></a>
<img src="images/i_070.png" width="550" height="452" alt="Fig. 49" title="" />
</div>


<p>Here is a very simple small power plant
suitable for driving boats up to 3<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> feet in
length. The boiler is shown in <a href="#fig_49">Figs. 49</a> and
<a href="#fig_50">50</a>. The method of assembling the boiler is
pictured clearly in <a href="#fig_49">Fig. 49</a>. A brass or
copper tube about 2<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches in diameter is
used. Two end pieces are cut to shape and
forced into the boiler ends. A hole is drilled
in the center of these pieces before they are
put in place. After the end pieces are forced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
in place solder is carefully flowed around
their edges. The brass rod is then threaded
at each end and placed concentrically within
the boiler, as shown in <a href="#fig_49">Fig. 49</a>. A nut is
placed on each end of this rod and tightened.
The nut is then soldered in place. This
brass rod, called a stay-rod, prevents the end
of the boiler from blowing out when the
steam pressure has reached its maximum
value. Three holes are drilled in the brass
tube, as shown. One is to accommodate the
steam feed-pipe that goes to the engine; another
is for the safety-valve, and still another
for the filling plug. The safety-valve
and filling plug are both shown in <a href="#fig_51">Fig. 51</a>.
The little spring on the safety-valve is adjustable,
so that the valve can be regulated
in order to prevent it from blowing off at
pressures lower than that at which the engine
operates.</p>

</div>

<p>A suitable firebox for the boiler is shown
clearly in <a href="#fig_52">Fig. 52</a>. This is cut to shape from
stovepipe iron and held together with small
rivets. Holes should be punched or drilled
in the side of the firebox to give the burner
a sufficient supply of air. The burner is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
illustrated clearly in <a href="#fig_52">Fig. 52</a>. The fuel-tank
can be made from an ordinary tin can with
the cover soldered on, and a hole made for a
cork by means of which it is filled with denatured
alcohol. A little pipe runs from
the fuel-tank to the burner. It is advisable,
if possible, to place a small valve in this pipe
to cut off the fuel supply when necessary.
The only other method of putting the burner
out would be to stand it on its end. The
burner consists of a rectangular tin box with
a top cut out as illustrated. A piece of brass
or copper gauze is placed in the top. Asbestos
wool is used to fill the can, and the alcohol
is drawn into the wool by capillary attraction,
where it burns with a steady hot
flame at the surface of the copper gauze. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the corner of the can near the feed-pipe another
small piece of copper gauze is soldered
as shown. This covers up
the feed-pipe entrance so
that the asbestos will not
plug up the pipe.</p>

<p>The engine to be used in
connection with the boiler
just described is shown in
<a href="#fig_53">Fig. 53</a>. This is a very
simple engine of the oscillation
type, and there should
be little trouble in making it.
A more mechanical drawing of the engine
is shown in <a href="#fig_54">Fig. 54</a>. The details of the engine
are shown in <a href="#fig_55">Fig. 55</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The cylinder of the engine should be made
first. This is made from a piece of brass
tubing with an internal diameter of <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch.
Two end pieces, or a cylinder-end cover and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
cylinder head, must be cut to fit inside the
cylinder. These should be cut to shape
from <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> inch brass, and a hole drilled in the
cylinder head <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch in diameter to accommodate
the piston-rod. The cylinder head
is then soldered in place. The cylinder-end
cover should be left until the piston-rod and
piston are made.</p>

<p>The piston head is cut to shape from a
piece of <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>-inch sheet brass, or it can be cut
from a piece of <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>-inch round brass with a
hacksaw. The piston-rod is soldered into a
hole in the piston-head. A small square
piece of brass is placed on the opposite end
of the piston-rod to act as a bearing. This
little piece is cut and drilled as shown in the
drawing. Before it is soldered in place on
the piston-rod the cylinder-end cover should
be placed on the rod. Both the piston and
the cylinder-end cover can then be placed inside
the cylinder, and the piston-end cover is
soldered in place. Before final assembling
the piston should be made to fit nicely into
the cylinder. This can be brought about by
applying emery cloth to the piston-head until
it slips nicely into the cylinder with little or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
no play. Thus a steam-tight fit is made, and
this contributes greatly to the efficiency and
power of the engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a name="fig_56" id="fig_56"></a><a name="fig_57" id="fig_57"></a>
<img src="images/i_076.png" width="350" height="256" alt="Fig. 56" title="" />
</div>


<p>The cylinder blocks are shown in <a href="#fig_55">Fig. 55</a>.
These are cut and brought to shape with a
hacksaw and file. With a half-round file
one side of one of the blocks is filed slightly
concave, so that it will fit on the outside of
the cylinder. Two <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch holes are drilled
in this piece as shown in the drawing. The
hole at the top is the steam entrance and exhaust
for the engine; that is, when the cylinder
is at one side steam enters this hole, and
when the crank throws the cylinder over to
the other side steam leaves through the same
hole after having expanded in the cylinder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
This cylinder block is soldered to the piston
as shown in <a href="#fig_56">Fig. 56</a>. The pivot upon which
the cylinder swings is then put in place in the
hole at the bottom of the block. Solder is
flowed around the pivot to hold it securely in
place.</p>

<p>The second cylinder block is now finished
according to the drawing. This has two
holes <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch in diameter bored in it. One
of these holes is the steam inlet and the other
the exhaust. When the cylinder is at one
side of its stroke the hole that was bored in
the top of the steam block which was soldered
on the cylinder is in line with the inlet hole
in the block under consideration. Steam
then enters the cylinder and forces the piston
down. This turns the crank around, and
the crank in turn pulls the piston over to the
opposite side, so that the hole in the first piston
block of the cylinder now comes in line
with the exhaust hole on the second cylinder
block. The steam in the cylinder escapes
and the same operation is repeated over
again. Of course, it must be understood
that this steam admission and exhaust takes
place very rapidly. The hole in the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
cylinder block, which goes over the pivot,
must be made a trifle more than <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch in
diameter, so that it will slide freely over the
pivot.</p>

<p>The engine is mounted on a very simple
frame, which is a piece of <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>-inch brass cut
and bent as illustrated. After it is cut and
bent to shape the second cylinder block is
soldered in place. The cylinder can then be
mounted. It will be seen that the pivot goes
through both the second cylinder block and
the engine standard. A small spring is
placed over the protruding end of the pivot
and a nut put in place. By turning this nut
the pressure on the face of the two cylinder
blocks can be adjusted, and the model engineer
must always remember that the pressure
on these springs must be greater than
the steam pressure in the feed-pipe. Otherwise
the steam pressure will force the cylinder-block
faces apart and steam leakage will
result. On the other hand, the pressure of
the spring should not be too great, since that
would interfere with the free movement of
the engine cylinder.</p>

<p>Nothing now remains to be made except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the crank and the flywheel. The crank revolves
in a small brass bearing which is soldered
in place on the engine standard. It
will be seen that the sheet brass that makes
up the engine standard is not thick enough
to offer a good bearing for the crank. The
crank is bent to shape from a piece of <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch
brass rod, and the author advises the builder
to heat the brass rod red-hot while the bending
is done. This will prevent it from fracturing,
and will also permit a sharp bend to
be made.</p>

<p>The flywheel is a circular piece of brass 1
inch in diameter. Its center is drilled out
and it is soldered to the crank as illustrated
in <a href="#fig_54">Fig. 54</a>. Two other holes <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch in diameter
are drilled in the flywheel as illustrated,
and two small brass pins are cut out from
<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch brass rod and forced into these holes
and then soldered. These provide a method
of driving the propeller-shaft that is shown
very clearly at <a href="#fig_57">Fig. 57</a>.</p>

<p>The steam feed-pipe that runs from the
boiler to the engine can be of small copper
tubing. It may be necessary to mount the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
engine on a small block, as shown in <a href="#fig_53">Fig. 53</a>.
After the steam in the boiler has reached a
sufficient pressure the engine crank should
be given a couple of twists in order to start
it. Before operating the engine a little lubricating
oil should be run into the cylinder
through the inlet or exhaust ports. The cylinder
should always be kept well lubricated.
The contacting faces of the cylinder blocks
should also be kept lubricated.</p>

<p><i>Caution.</i> Always keep water in the boiler.
Never permit it to run dry, as this would
cause a boiler explosion. When the engine
is started and cannot be made to run, take
the burner from under the boiler so that
steam will cease to be generated. With the
safety-valve the model boat builder need have
little fear of an explosion. Nevertheless the
foregoing directions should be carefully adhered
to.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>AN ELECTRIC LAUNCH</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE little electric launch to be described
is of very simple construction, and
when finished it will provide the builder with
a very shipshape little model from which he
will be able to derive a good deal of pleasure.
It has a speed of from 2<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> to 3 miles an hour
when equipped with dry batteries or storage
batteries. The hull is of the Sharpie type,
and this offers very little trouble in cutting
out and assembling.</div>

<p>The general appearance of the boat and
hull will be gathered from the drawings.
The pieces necessary to assemble the hull are
shown in <a href="#fig_58">Fig. 58</a>. Only five pieces are necessary:
two side pieces, a stern piece, a bow
piece, and a bottom piece. The length of the
boat over all is 40 inches with a 7-inch beam.
The widest part of the boat is 1 foot 10 inches
from the bow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>After the pieces that form the hull are cut
they are thoroughly sandpapered to produce
a smooth surface. The heavy imperfections
in the wood can be taken out with coarse
paper, and the finishing can be done with a
finer paper. It is understood that sandpapering
should always be done with the
grain, never across the grain. The sides of
the boat are cut about <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch thick, but they
are planed thinner in places where the bend
is most pronounced. The side pieces are 2<span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>
inches deep at the stern and 2<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches at the
stern. There is a gradual curve from the
bow to the stern, which is more marked toward
the head.</p>

<p>The stern piece is thicker than the side
pieces, being made of <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>-inch wood. It is
cut to the shape shown at <a href="#fig_58">Fig. 58</a>, and beveled
along the bottom edge to enable it to be
fixed on the slant. The bow piece is a triangle
2<span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches in length.</p>

<p>After the parts are thoroughly finished
with sandpaper the stern piece is fixed in
position. In making all the joints on the
boat the builder should see that plenty of
fairly thick paint is run in while the joint is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
being screwed up. This will help greatly in
making the boat water-tight. Plenty of <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>-inch
brass wood-screws are used in assembling
the hull. All the holes for the wood-screws
should be countersunk so that the
heads will come flush with the surface of the
hull. Now one of the sides should be
screwed to the stern piece, at the same time
bending the bottom and side to meet. This
is done gradually, inch by inch, and screws
are put in place at equal distances. When
the bow is reached, the side piece is beveled
to fit the bow piece, which should already
have been screwed into place. The other
side of the boat is treated in a similar
manner, and the young worker should take
care to keep the side and bow piece perfectly
square and upright. This may sound easy
on paper, but it will be found that a good
deal of care must be exercised to produce
this result.</p>

<p>After the hull has been assembled it is
given a good coat of paint inside and out.
When the first coat is dry the holes left by
the screw-heads are carefully puttied over,
and the hull is given a second coat of paint.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
This procedure will produce a perfectly
water-tight hull.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig_58" id="fig_58"></a><a name="fig_59" id="fig_59"></a><a name="fig_63" id="fig_63"></a>
<img src="images/i_084.png" width="400" height="413" alt="Fig. 58" title="" />
</div>


<p>The stern tube is <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch, outside diameter.
A hole is bored in the bottom of the boat to
receive the stern tube. This job must be
done cautiously; otherwise the bottom of
the boat may be ruined. It is best to screw
a substantial block to the inside of the boat.
This block should be cut to fit the bottom
and will act as a support for drilling. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
will also help greatly to make a water-tight
joint around the tube. The distance from
the point where the stern tube passes through
the bottom to the stern should be about 12<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>
inches. The stern tube should be mounted
as nearly parallel with the bottom as possible,
since on this depends the speed of the
boat. As the angle of the propeller-shaft
increases, the speed of the boat will decrease.
In drilling the hole the boat-builder should
be careful to keep the drill running along
the central line of the boat.</p>

<p>As before mentioned, the stern tube is a
piece of brass tubing <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch in diameter and
8 inches long. It is filed square at both ends,
and a brass plug is fastened with solder in
each end. The tube is then filled with
melted vaseline, which is allowed to cool.
The hole in the hull around the tube is then
well smeared with thick paint. When this
is done, a layer of red lead or putty is placed
around the joint both on the inside and the
outside of the boat.</p>

<p>While the putty is drying the spray-hood
or turtle-deck can be made. This is bent to
shape from a piece of tinplate and extends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
half way down the boat. When the turtle-deck
is finished, it is best to lay it aside, before
finally fastening it in place, until the entire
boat is completed.</p>

<p>The wooden part of the deck is made of
<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch wood and scribed with a sharp knife
to represent planking. This method of producing
planking was described in detail in
Chapter II.</p>

<p>Toward the stern of the boat and just behind
the motor a hatchway is fitted to give
access to the batteries and starting switch.</p>

<p>The finished Sharpie hull without its driving
batteries or motor should weigh about
1 pound 3 ounces. The hull being finished,
let us consider the electric propelling equipment.</p>

<p>A <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch cold-rolled steel driving or propeller-shaft
is used. The shaft is 13 inches
long and a gear-wheel 1 inch in diameter is
fixed to one end of this shaft. This gear-wheel
meshes with a brass pinion on the
motor-shaft. This forms a 3<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> to 1 reduction
gear, which produces a greatly increased
speed of the boat. The other end of the propeller-shaft
rests in the skeg bearing. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
this present case this consists of a tube about
<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch long, which is made for a revolving
fit on the propeller-shaft and supported by a
sheet-metal bracket. This is shown in <a href="#fig_63">Fig. 63</a>
. The end of the propeller also revolves
adjacent to the bearing in the skeg.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="getting" id="getting"></a>
<img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="550" height="385" alt="GETTING READY FOR A TRIP" title="" />
<span class="caption">GETTING READY FOR A TRIP<br />Heating the blow-torch to a point where it will burn automatically</span>
</div>


<p>The propeller is a three-blade affair with
a diameter of 2<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches. It is attached to
the propeller-shaft with a set-screw. The
motor is a very simple type obtainable in the
open market. It is similar to one shown in
<a href="#fig_41">Fig. 41</a>. As before mentioned, either dry
or storage batteries may be used as a source
of current. The writer strongly advises the
use of storage batteries if possible. The initial
cost of these batteries is greater than that
for dry batteries; but, on the other hand, the
small storage battery can be charged repeatedly
and will outlast many dry batteries. If
the boat is used much the storage battery
will probably be the more economical of the
two.</p>

<p>The steering gear of the boat is very
simple. The rudder works in a bearing that
is screwed to the stern piece. The end of the
rudder-shaft is tapped, and a brass screw is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
used to clamp it in position after setting it
with the fingers. The rudder-shaft is a <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>-inch
brass rod. The lower end of this rod
is slit with a hacksaw and the rudder is
placed in this. Solder is then flowed along
the joint.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="all" id="all"></a>
<img src="images/i_089.jpg" width="500" height="361" alt="ALL READY TO GO!" title="" />
<span class="caption">ALL READY TO GO!<br />A little boat with steam up, ready for a trip when her owner releases her</span>
</div>



<p>Of course, the builder may paint his boat
whatever color he may select; but
a maroon hull with a white-enameled
spray-hood or turtle-deck
makes a very pleasing combination.
<a href="#fig_60">Fig. 60</a> shows a rough
plan of the general arrangement
of the power machinery. <a href="#fig_61">Figs. 61</a>,
<a href="#fig_62">62</a> and <a href="#fig_63">63</a> will do much to give
the reader a clear idea of the
method of construction which could not be
gained by reading a description.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig_60" id="fig_60"></a>
<img src="images/i_090a.png" width="400" height="170" alt="Fig. 60" title="" />

<img src="images/i_090b.png" width="105" height="250" alt="Fig. 61" title="" />
</div>

<p>The general appearance of the boat can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
improved materially in many ways. For instance,
a little stack or ventilator may be
added to the turtle-deck,
and a little flag-stick carrying
a tiny flag may be
placed on the bow and on
the stern.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a name="fig_62" id="fig_62"></a>
<img src="images/i_091.png" width="200" height="139" alt="Fig. 62" title="" />
</div>

<p>The motor current should be turned on
only when necessary, for dry-cells deteriorate
rapidly when in use, and small storage
batteries quickly lose their charge, although
they will last much longer than dry-cells and
give much better service.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>A STEAM LAUNCH</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE steam launch <i>Nancy Lee</i> is an attractive
little craft when finished and it
is capable of attaining considerable speed.
It is really designed after the cruising type
of motor-boats. This type of boat is particularly
adaptable for simple model-making,
owing to the elimination of awkward fittings.
The power machinery is of very simple construction
and presents no real difficulty.</div>

<p>The following materials are necessary to
construct the <i>Nancy Lee</i>:</p>

<div class='poem2'>
Large wood block for hull.<br />
Thin white pine for deck, etc.<br />
Sheet-metal tube, rod and wire for the boiler, engine, etc.<br />
Lamp-wick, paint, screws, and brads<br />
Miscellaneous fittings<br />
</div>

<p>The actual expense necessary to construct
the boat is very small.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Having obtained the block for the hull,
you are ready to start work. The hull, when
planed on all sides, should be 30 inches long,
6<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches wide, and 3<span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches deep. A
center line is drawn down the length of the
hull, and five cross-section lines are drawn at
right angles to the center line 5 inches apart.
On these lines the builder should mark off the
greatest lengths of the boat, taking the dimensions
from the half-breadth drawing
shown in <a href="#fig_64">Fig. 64</a>. It will be noted that the
deck is wider than the L. W. L. forward and
narrower than the L. W. L. at the stern.
The block should be cut to the widest line
on the half-breadth part.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;"><a name="fig_65" id="fig_65"></a><a name="fig_64" id="fig_64"></a><a name="fig_67" id="fig_67"></a>
<img src="images/i_093.png" width="425" height="191" alt="Fig. 65" title="" />
</div>

<p>The half-widths in <a href="#fig_64">Fig. 64</a> are drawn
each side of the center line on the block.
The block will be cut out to this line and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
planed up as true as possible. The builder
should then project the section lines with a
set square on each side of the boat, mark
off the profile from the sheer plan, <a href="#fig_65">Fig. 65</a>,
and cut the block to this line, afterward
planing it up true.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><a name="fig_66" id="fig_66"></a>
<img src="images/i_094.png" width="250" height="182" alt="Fig. 66" title="" />
</div>

<p>The blocks should now appear as sketched
in <a href="#fig_66">Fig. 66</a>. It is now ready for the shaping
of its exterior. A plane, a chisel, and a
draw-knife are the only tools necessary to
bring the hull to the correct shape. The
cardboard templates must be cut, one for
each half-section, as shown in the body plan,
<a href="#fig_67">Fig. 67</a>. These templates serve to show the
proper outside shape of the hull. The block
for the hull must be cut away until each one
of these templates fits properly into place.
The various stages are indicated in <a href="#fig_68">Figs. 68</a>
and <a href="#fig_69">69</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a name="fig_68" id="fig_68"></a>
<img src="images/i_095a.png" width="300" height="173" alt="Fig. 68" title="" />
</div>

<p>The interior of the board is gouged out
with a gouging chisel, and if the builder desires
a uniform result he should make inside
templates. In gouging out the interior of
the hull the chisel or gouge should be handled
very carefully; otherwise it is liable to slip
and spoil the entire hull.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a name="fig_69" id="fig_69"></a>
<img src="images/i_095b.png" width="300" height="145" alt="Fig. 69" title="" />
</div>

<p>The next job is to cut and properly fit the
raised portion or forecastle. A piece of
wood 1<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches thick, 15 inches long, and
6<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches wide must be prepared and laid in
place on the hull. The shape of the hull is
marked off with a pencil and the wood sawed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
along this line. The inner portion is also
cut out, thus making a V-shaped piece which
must be glued and screwed in place, as shown
in <a href="#fig_70">Fig. 70</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="fig_70" id="fig_70"></a><a name="fig_71" id="fig_71"></a>
<img src="images/i_096.png" width="450" height="327" alt="Fig. 71" title="" />
</div>


<p>The oval air-vents shown in the drawing
can be cut at this time. The hull is neatly
finished by cutting in the sheer or curvature
of the hull and sandpapering it all over. A
cross-beam or support, <i>C</i>, <a href="#fig_70">Fig. 70</a>, is cut and
fitted as illustrated. This particular piece
supports the fore-deck, and also carries the
main-deck, as well as bracing the boat together.
This piece should be <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> inch thick
and cut from solid oak.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The decks can be made of a good quality
of white pine. The builder should select
clean pieces, free from knots and blemishes.
It only requires to be cut to shape and then
fixed to the hull with a few brads. The edge
should be cleaned up flush with the hull by
the aid of a plane. The opening for the
cock-pit, shown in the drawing in <a href="#fig_71">Fig. 71</a>,
is to be cut in the deck. The coamings and
seats are cut to the sizes indicated in the
drawings. They are then glued and pinned
together. When fitted to the deck the result
will be somewhat as shown in <a href="#fig_71">Fig. 71</a>.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;"><a name="fig_72" id="fig_72"></a>
<img src="images/i_097.png" width="150" height="81" alt="Fig. 72" title="" />
</div>
<p>The fore-deck is prepared in a similar
manner; but, since this is to be removable,
two battens must be fitted to the under side
to keep it in place. The openings for the
hatchways can be cut and the hatch-covers
made by cutting another piece of wood <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>
inch thick to form an edging. A cover piece
to go over the small pieces, removed
from cutting out the
hatch opening, is shown at <a href="#fig_72">Fig. 72</a>
. A coping-saw will be found very useful
for this work. The covers are neatly
rounded on the edge and nicely finished.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig_74" id="fig_74"></a><a name="fig_76" id="fig_76"></a>
<img src="images/i_098b.png" width="400" height="162" alt="Fig. 74" title="" />
</div>
<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><a name="fig_73" id="fig_73"></a>
<img src="images/i_098a.png" width="250" height="253" alt="Fig. 73" title="" />
</div>

<p>Fig. 73 will give the reader a very good
idea of the appearance of the boat at this
stage. It will be seen that the sketch shows
the deck broken away
so as to render the cross-batten
visible, which
also shows the fair-lead
at <i>F</i>, <a href="#fig_73">Fig. 73</a>. This is
cut from two small
pieces of <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>-inch stuff,
glued and pinned in
place. The forward deck is completed
by the addition of cowl-ventilators, cut
from hard wood and screwed in place.
The flag-mast is made from a short piece of
<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>-inch wire. The details of the mooring-cleats
are shown in <a href="#fig_74">Fig. 74</a>. They are
fashioned by using a small screw-eye and
soldering a short piece of brass wire through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the eye. An oblong metal plate is then cut
and a central hole drilled. This plate is
soldered to the shank of the screw-eye and
the cleat is complete. One of these devices
is to be fitted to the fore-deck and two on
the main-deck and stern.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig_75" id="fig_75"></a>
<img src="images/i_099.png" width="400" height="208" alt="Fig. 75" title="" />
</div>

<p>The rudder and steering gear will be considered
next. <a href="#fig_75">Fig. 75</a> shows the stern of the
boat with the rudder gear mounted in place.
It will be noted that the rudder-blade is
merely a piece of sheet brass cut to shape
and soldered into the rudder-post <i>M</i>, which
is slit to accommodate it. The rudder-post
is hung in two screw-eyes on the stern of
the boat. A small wheel about 1 inch in
diameter, with an edge filed in it, is soldered
to the top of the rudder-post. A fine cord
or string, well stretched and oiled, is attached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to the wheel and led through two screw-eyes
on the deck. From this it is led through an
opening in the coaming to a drum on the
steering column, which is turned by another
small wheel similar to that used on the
rudder-post, but with a round edge. The
steering column is merely a piece of <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch
wire, held in place by two small screw-eyes
fixed in the coaming and with a tube-brush
soldered on to keep the wire in position.
The drum is simply a hard-wood bushing
driven tightly in place.</p>

<p>The power machinery for the <i>Nancy Lee</i>
must be considered at this time. This is
really one of the most interesting parts of the
construction. The general appearance of
the power plant can be seen by referring to
<a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77</a>, which is a view of the complete
boiler and engine mounted together on the
same base. The boiler is shown at <i>A</i> and
the safety-valve and filler at <i>L</i>. The base or
firebox <i>B</i> protects the burner from stray
drafts of air, and also supports the boiler.</p>

<p>The lamp or burner consists of a receptacle
<i>C</i> for containing the denatured alcohol.
The denatured alcohol is inserted through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the filler-tube <i>E</i>, which is kept closed with a
cork. The upright tube <i>D</i> is fitted so that
air can go into the receptacle containing the
alcohol. Three burners are necessary to fire
the boiler. These are fitted as shown in <i>F</i>,
and they give sufficient heat to produce
steam enough to drive the cylinder <i>G</i>. The
steam is conducted to the cylinder through
the short pipe <i>K</i>. The steam-cylinder has
the usual piston and rod, which drives the
circular crank <i>H</i>. This crank is mounted on
a crankshaft carried on the metal tube <i>M</i>.
As will be noticed, the cylinder is of the
simple oscillating type mounted on a standard,
formed as part of the boiler casing,
and stiffened by two angle-plates <i>L</i>.</p>

<p>A heavy flywheel, <i>J</i>, is now fitted to the inside
end of the crankshaft. This wheel
should be a lead casting, and as heavy as
possible. A heavy flywheel contributes
much to the operating efficiency of the engine.
The propeller-shaft and crank are
shown at <i>N</i> in the insert.</p>

<p>The boiler is made from a strong tin can
about 1<span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches in diameter and 4<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches
long. It is cleaned inside and out, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the seams are double-soldered. The lid is
also soldered on the can. This little boiler,
although not elaborately made, will be found
capable of standing up under considerable
steam-pressure, and so no fear need be had
of accidents by explosion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig_77" id="fig_77"></a><a name="fig_78" id="fig_78"></a><a name="fig_79" id="fig_79"></a><a name="fig_80" id="fig_80"></a><a name="fig_81" id="fig_81"></a><a name="fig_82" id="fig_82"></a><a name="fig_83" id="fig_83"></a>
<a href="images/i_102-big.png"><img src="images/i_102.png" width="400" height="472" alt="Fig. 83" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>A little safety-valve and filler-plug suitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
for use on the boiler are shown clearly in
<a href="#fig_78">Fig. 78</a>. A piece of sheet tin is cut out to
the size and shape illustrated in <a href="#fig_79">Fig. 79</a> at <i>A</i>.
The piece is bent up at the dotted lines and
the seams are soldered. Two angle-plates,
<i>B</i>, are then cut and fitted and soldered in
place. Next a piece of brass tube with a
<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch bore and 1 inch long is cut and soldered
in place for the bearing of the crankshaft.
A lead flywheel 1<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches in diameter
and <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch thick is then mounted firmly
on a piece of straight steel wire 1<span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches
long, which acts as a shaft.</p>

<p>The shaft is made to run freely in the
crankshaft bearing that was previously
soldered in place. The cylinder is shown in
section in <a href="#fig_80">Fig. 80</a>. If the reader will refer
back to the construction of the engine described
in Chapter 4 he will readily understand
the operation and construction of this
particular engine.</p>

<p>A little crank must be cut from <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>-inch
brass, and soldered to the crankshaft after
fitting a wire crank-pin to the outer edge.
This crank-pin should be of such a size that
the joint on the end of the piston-rod shown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
at <i>A</i>, <a href="#fig_80">Fig. 80</a>, turns on it easily. The throw
should be only half the stroke of the engine,
which is <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> of an inch.</p>

<p>The boiler is now fixed in place by bending
the lugs <i>B</i>, <a href="#fig_79">Fig. 79</a>, so that they just support
the boiler nicely. They are then
soldered in place. Next fit the short steam-pipe
<i>K</i> between the boiler and the steam
block on the cylinder. The builder should
take care to keep the steam-pipe well up to
the top of the boiler.</p>

<p>The lamp should be built at this time.
The container for the denatured alcohol is
made from a well soldered tin box of suitable
size. It can also be made by cutting
a sheet of tin to the size and shape shown
in <a href="#fig_81">Fig. 81</a>. The corner joints are soldered
and then a tin lid is soldered in place. The
builder should not forget to make the filler-tube
<i>E</i> and air-tube <i>D</i>, as shown in <a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77</a>,
before soldering the top piece in place. The
burners should be made as high as the container,
and these should be made from little
pieces of tin bent to shape and soldered on
to a bottom pipe, as shown in <a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77</a>. The
builder should also remember to cut the holes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
through this pipe so that the alcohol can get
into the burner-tubes, and also to solder the
open end of the bottom or feed tube. Before
the wicks are put into the lamps, the
container should be tested by filling it with
alcohol to see that it is perfectly tight at all
joints. If it is not the container should be
gone over again with solder to assure its
being leak-proof.</p>

<p>Before operating the engine with steam,
it can be tested with a small bicycle pump
through the opening for the safety-valve.
The engine should turn over briskly at every
stroke of the pump, providing it does not
come to rest at "dead center." If it does
come to rest at "dead center," where no air
can enter the piston, the crankshaft should
be given a little twist and the engine will
then start. Before steam is applied it will
be well to experiment until the engine runs
with the air-pump.</p>

<p>Having made the engine run smoothly
with air, steam can be generated in the
boiler. The wicks should not be placed too
tightly in the burners. After they are in
place the container may be filled with denatured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
alcohol, and the burners lighted and
placed under the boiler. In a very few minutes
steam will be up. At the first indication
of pressure in the boiler the engine
should be given a twist with the fingers until
it starts and goes of its own accord. The
constructor should remember to keep his
engine well lubricated.</p>

<p>The propeller-shaft is merely a piece of
steel wire, perfectly straight and fitted with
a crank <i>A</i>, <a href="#fig_82">Fig. 82</a>. This crank is similar
to the one fitted to the engine, but with a
small slot cut out for the crank-pin to fit
into. This is done so that, as the crank-pin
on the engine turns around, it also turns a
slotted crank on the propeller-shaft.</p>

<p>A short piece of tube, <i>C</i>, is now fitted to
a flat brass plate, <i>D</i>. The plate is mounted
at an angle to the tube, so that when it is
in place on the stern of the boat the propeller-shaft
will be in line with the crankshaft
of the engine.</p>

<p>A clearance hole is now drilled through
the hull, so that the propeller-shaft can be
put in place. Solder the tube to the plate,
and punch four small holes in the plate, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
that it can be screwed firmly to the hull.
Solder a short piece of tube, as shown at <i>B</i>,
<a href="#fig_82">Fig. 82</a>, to keep the propeller-shaft in position.</p>

<p>The propeller must now be made. This is
easily done by cutting out a disk of brass 1<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>
inches in diameter, as shown in <a href="#fig_83">Fig. 83</a>. The
shaded portions of the brass disk are cut
away. The blades are bent to shape, care
being taken to see that they are all alike.
This done, the propeller is soldered to the
propeller-shaft.</p>

<p>The only part of the job that remains is
to screw the boiler in place under the fore-deck
of the boat. This done, the <i>Nancy Lee</i>
is ready for her trial. The fore-deck should
be made removable by fitting it with pins or
screws with the heads cut off, so that the
deck only needs pushing into place. This
little boat should be capable of attaining a
speed of from four to five miles an hour if
it is made carefully and according to the
directions outlined in this Chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>AN ELECTRICALLY DRIVEN LAKE FREIGHTER</h3>


<div class='cap'>A PROTOTYPE of the model lake
freighter described in this Chapter
will probably be familiar to many readers.
It is a type of boat used on the Great Lakes,
and, owing to its peculiarity of design, it
lends itself very well to construction in model
form.</div>

<p>The lines of the boat may be seen very
clearly in <a href="#fig_84">Fig. 84</a>.</p>

<p>The hull of the model freighter measures
four feet over all, and the beam at the water-line
is 8 inches. The extreme draft will be
in the neighborhood of 5 inches. This
model, when completed, will be capable of
carrying considerable weight; in fact, it is
able to accommodate thirty-five pounds in
weight when used in fresh water. This will
give the builder an opportunity to install a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
very substantial power equipment with little
regard for weight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="fig_84" id="fig_84"></a><a name="fig_85" id="fig_85"></a>
<img src="images/i_109.png" width="550" height="437" alt="Fig. 84" title="" />
</div>


<p>The hull is made according to the built-up
principle, and the constructor will have to
cut his templates before attempting the shaping
of the hull. Owing to the depth of the
model, it will be necessary to use about ten
planks. The plank that is used to form the
bottom of the boat is not gouged out.
Every other plank is gouged out with a saw
and chisel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>The bottom plank is shaped with a knife
to conform to the lines of the boat. In building
up the hull with the planks, they should
first be smeared with glue, and when put in
place a few brass brads should be driven in.
As mentioned in an earlier part of this book,
iron nails should not be used in work of this
nature, owing to the fact that they will rust
and cause trouble. The brass brads are
placed about one inch apart the entire length
of the boards. The hull is finished with a
plane and sandpaper, and after it has been
brought to shape in this way and finished, a
coat of paint is applied. Black with dark
red trimmings makes a very good combination
for a boat of this type.</p>

<p>The deck is made from a piece of <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>-inch
pine board. Seven hatches are added to the
deck. Six of these hatches can be made by
merely gluing a square piece of <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>-inch wood
to the deck. The seventh hatch should be
made with a hole cut in the deck, so that
access can be had to the power motor.</p>

<p>The deck-house, wheel-house, and chart-house,
as well as the bridge, should be constructed
of tin, which may be salvaged from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
clean tin cans. The bridge is provided with
spray-cloths made from white adhesive tape,
as outlined in Chapter 9. The port-holes in
the deck-house and hull are made by little
pieces of brass forced in place over a small
piece of mica. The life-boats, which are
carried on top of the engine-house, are
whittled out of a solid piece of wood and
painted white. Life-boats are always
painted white, regardless of the color of the
boat upon which they are used. The life-boats
are held by means of string and small
dummy pulleys to davits made of heavy
stovepipe wire. A rub-streak made of a
piece of <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>-inch square pine is tacked to each
side of the hull just below the sheer-line.
The rub-streak should be tacked in place with
nails such as those used on cigar-boxes.</p>

<p>The funnel measures 1 inch in diameter by
4 inches long. A small exhaust steam pipe,
which can be made from a piece of brass
tubing, is mounted directly aft of the funnel.
The forward deck fittings consist mainly of
a steering-boom, two bollards, two fair-heads,
and four life-buoys mounted on the
bridge. The main-deck is equipped with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
six bollards and two covered ventilators,
each <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch in diameter. The foremast is
properly stayed in the deck, and should be
fitted with rat-lines. The rat-lines can be
made with black thread and finished with
varnish, which when dry will tend to hold
the threads in shape.</p>

<p>The rudder is cut from a piece of sheet
brass to the shape shown, and fitted with a
quadrant. The engine cabin can be made
from cigar-box wood. The windows and
doors can either be painted in place, or the
windows can be cut and backed up with sheet
celluloid. A good substitute for painted
doors will be found in small pieces of tin
painted a different color from the cabin.
The same procedure may be followed in fitting
the windows and doors to the forward
cabin.</p>

<p>We are now ready to consider the power
plant. Owing to the large displacement of
the boat, it will carry a fairly heavy storage
battery. The electric motor and storage
battery are mounted in the manner shown
in <a href="#fig_85">Fig. 85</a>, which will also give the reader
an idea of the appearance of the finished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
model. As the drawing indicates, it will not
be necessary to tilt the motor to any great
degree in order to bring the propeller to the
proper depth. This is because of the depth
of the boat. Instead of a string or belt to
connect the motor with the propeller, the
shaft of the motor is taken out and replaced
by a longer steel rod that will serve both
as a motor-shaft and a propeller-shaft.
The propeller-shaft extends from the motor
through the stern-tube. The propeller used
for this model is a three-blade affair, 3 inches
in diameter. It must be of this size in order
to propel a boat of these dimensions at a
consistent speed.</p>

<p>Care must be taken in mounting the motor
in this way. If it is not mounted directly in
line with the stern-tube the propeller-shaft
will have a tendency to bind. However,
with a little care no trouble should be experienced
from this source. The storage
battery used should be of the four-volt forty-ampere
hour variety. This boat will be capable
of carrying such a battery and this
weight should just bring the craft down to
her load water-line. The whole deck is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
made removable, so that the storage battery
can be taken in and out at times when it is
necessary to recharge it. A battery of this
capacity, however, will drive a small motor
similar to the type used on the boat for some
time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>AN ELECTRIC SUBMARINE-CHASER</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE submarine chaser design given in
the drawings and described in the text
of this Chapter is a presentable little boat
with pleasing lines and deck fittings. There
is nothing difficult about its construction,
and, considering the amount of work necessary
to produce it, it is probably one of the
most pleasing boats described in the book.
If made correctly it will look "speedy" and
shipshape.</div>

<p>The general outline of the boat can be
gathered from <a href="#fig_86">Figs. 86</a>, <a href="#fig_87">87</a>, and <a href="#fig_88">88</a>. <a href="#fig_86">Fig. 86</a>
gives a side view of the craft; <a href="#fig_87">Fig. 87</a> shows
the bow, while <a href="#fig_88">Fig. 88</a> gives the deck-plan.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="fig_86" id="fig_86"></a><a name="fig_87" id="fig_87"></a><a name="fig_88" id="fig_88"></a>
<img src="images/i_116.png" width="450" height="377" alt="Fig. 86" title="" />
</div>


<p>Notice first the construction of the hull.
This is made according to the Sharpie type,
but the lines are changed to give the boat a
more graceful appearance. This is done by
changing the shape of the deck and the bottom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
pieces. <a href="#fig_89">Fig. 89</a> shows the various pieces
necessary to construct the hull. It will be
seen that the forward portion of the bottom
piece is narrower than the deck piece, and
broadens out so that it is wider at the stern
than the deck piece. The deck piece has a
maximum width of 5 inches, while the bottom
piece has a width of 4 inches at the forward
section. The deck measures 3<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches
at the stern, while the bottom piece measures
4<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches at the stern. This produces a
half-inch taper on each side of the stern. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
half-inch taper is also produced on the bow
portion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig_89" id="fig_89"></a><a name="fig_90" id="fig_90"></a><a name="fig_91" id="fig_91"></a>
<img src="images/i_117.png" width="500" height="434" alt="Fig. 90" title="" />
</div>


<p>The hull of the boat can be made from
<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch mahogany. If this is not available,
choose some other close-grained wood, free
from knots and blemishes. Paper patterns
are made to correspond with the general
shape of the pieces that form the hull as
given in <a href="#fig_89">Fig. 89</a>. The pieces, after being
marked, are cut to shape with a keyhole-saw.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
After this is done their edges should be
trimmed neatly with a jack-plane.</p>

<p>The two sides pieces are now screwed to
the bow piece by small brass screws. After
this is done the bottom piece is fastened to
the side pieces the entire length of the boat.
Next the first cross-piece, as shown in <a href="#fig_90">Fig. 90</a>
, is screwed in place. This cross-piece
should be 4<span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches in length, so that the
width of the hull at this point is just 5 inches.
The next cross-piece should correspond to
the width of the deck piece at the section of
the hull where it is placed. The same holds
true for the third cross-piece. When the
third cross-piece has been screwed in place,
the stern piece is put in position.</p>

<p>The joints of the hull should then be
smeared with either pitch or bath-tub
enamel or a thick mixture of white lead may
be used.</p>

<p>After having made sure that the hull is
perfectly water-tight the worker can proceed
to install the power equipment. This
consists of a small battery motor driven with
two dry cells. The design and installation
of such things as stern-tubes and propeller-shafts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
have been taken up in detail in an
earlier part of this book. The strut that
holds the propeller-shaft is shown in <a href="#fig_91">Fig. 91</a>
. This consists merely of a brass bushing
held in a bracket made of a strip of brass
<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch wide. The brass strip is wound
around the bushing and soldered. It is held
to the bottom of the hull by means of two
8-32 brass machine screws. These screws
should be tightened to prevent leakage. It
would be inadvisable to use wood-screws for
this purpose, owing to the fact that the bottom
piece of the boat is thin.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;"><a name="fig_92" id="fig_92"></a><a name="fig_93" id="fig_93"></a>
<img src="images/i_119.png" width="350" height="338" alt="Fig. 93" title="" />
</div>


<p>The two dry batteries for the motor are
held in two tin troughs, as illustrated in <a href="#fig_92">Fig. 92</a>
. These troughs are fastened to the side
of the boat by means of small bolts. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
will prevent the boat from shifting its cargo;
in other words, they hold the batteries in
place and thereby prevent the boat from listing.</p>

<p>The deck and deck fittings should now be
furnished. The construction of the forward
cabin is shown in <a href="#fig_93">Fig. 93</a>. The sides and
back are formed with cigar-box wood, while
the curved front can best be made with a
piece of tin. The top is also cut to shape
from cigar-box wood, and should overlap
about <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch. The pilot-house is simplicity
itself, being made of a piece of curved tin
with three windows cut in it. Four little
lugs cut in the tin are bent on the inside and
each provided with a hole. These lugs are
used to tack the pilot-house to the deck. A
small skylight is produced from a solid piece
of wood and tacked in place as illustrated in
the drawing.</p>

<p>The builder is cautioned not to destroy
the appearance of his boat by making the
mast too large. After the mast has been
nicely sandpapered, a little wire frame is
bent to shape and fastened to the top, as
shown in <a href="#fig_87">Fig. 87</a>. The little wire railing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
that is placed in front of the mast is then
bent to shape, and this and the mast are put
in their permanent position. The mast can
be held to the deck by boring a hole a little
under size and smearing the bottom of the
mast with a little glue before it is forced in.
Pieces of black thread are run from the top
of the mast to the railing at the bottom, as
shown. These threads are used to hoist signal
flags. Two little angle-pieces are placed
on the forward deck, one on each side of the
pilot-house. These are for the harbor
lights. One should be painted green and
one red.</p>

<p>This finishes the forward cabin. It
should be placed in the center of the deck
and the position it occupies should be marked
out with a pencil. This portion of the deck
should be carefully cut out with a coping-saw.
The cabin is then forced into the opening.
The fit should be fairly tight, so that
it will not be necessary to employ nails or
glue, as this is the only way in which the
interior of the hull is made accessible.</p>

<p>Two ventilators are placed just back of
the forward cabin. Between the forward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
cabin and the cabin aft there is placed a
rapid-fire gun. The details of this gun are
given in <a href="#fig_94">Fig. 94</a>. The barrel of the gun is
made of a piece of brass rod. A hole is
drilled through this rod
with a small drill and a
piece of copper wire is inserted.
A square piece of
brass for the breech is then
drilled out to receive the
barrel. One end of the
barrel is placed in this hole
and held with a drop of solder. A drop of
solder should also be used on the copper wire
that runs through the barrel. The bearing
and shield of the gun are made from thin
sheet brass, as illustrated. Three holes are
drilled in the bearing bracket, two through
which the wire passes and one through which
the small nail is placed to hold the bearing to
the wooden standard. The shield is forced
over the barrel and held in place with a drop
of solder. When the barrel is mounted in
the bearing, a drop of solder should be put
in place to prevent the barrel of the gun
from tipping.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 228px;"><a name="fig_94" id="fig_94"></a>
<img src="images/i_122.png" width="228" height="250" alt="Fig. 94" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The cabin which is placed aft on the boat,
is of very simple construction. It is made
up entirely of cigar-box wood tacked together,
and the top should overlap <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch.
The cabin is then tacked to the deck of the
boat. The mast should be only three-fourths
as high as the forward mast, and a
tiny hole is drilled near the top. Into this
hole a small piece of soft wire is placed, and
from this wire a thread runs to the cabin.
A small flag can then be placed on the thread,
as illustrated in <a href="#fig_86">Fig. 86</a>.</p>

<p>Six port-holes are now bored in each side
of the hull with a <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>-inch bit. These can be
backed up with mica or celluloid. Five
smaller port-holes made with a <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>-inch drill
are then bored in each side of the forward
cabin. Three are placed in the aft cabin.</p>

<p>With the exception of painting, the hull
is now ready to be launched. Before finally
applying the paint the hull should be given
a thorough rubbing with sandpaper. A battleship
gray with maroon trimmings makes
a pleasing color combination for this boat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>BOAT FITTINGS</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE model boat builder generally has
some trouble in producing the necessary
fittings for his boats. It is practically
impossible to buy such things in this country,
and so it is necessary to make them.</div>

<p>Using a little care, it is possible to make
presentable fittings by utilizing odds and
ends found about the household and shop.
In this Chapter the author will describe the
construction of the more important fittings
necessary to model boats, such as stacks,
searchlights, bollards, cowl-ventilators, davits,
and binnacles.</p>

<p>The smokestack is probably one of the
easiest things to produce. A very suitable
method of producing a smokestack is shown
in <a href="#fig_95">Fig. 95</a>. The stack itself is cut from a
piece of thin brass tubing. It is also possible
to use a small tin can of the proper diameter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
In both cases, of course, paint must
be applied to improve the appearance of the
brass or tin. If the stack is painted either
gray or white a red band near the top of
the stack produces a good finish and makes
it look more shipshape.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 303px;"><a name="fig_95" id="fig_95"></a><a name="fig_97" id="fig_97"></a>
<img src="images/i_125.png" width="303" height="350" alt="Fig. 95" title="" />
</div>



<p>The method of anchoring the stack to the
deck of the boat is shown very clearly. First
a block of wood is cut about the same diameter
as the internal diameter of the stack.
This block of wood is then forced up into the
stack. A small square base is then cut, and
fastened to the block on the inside of the
stack with a wood-screw. It might be mentioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
here that it is often necessary to drill
a hole with a small hand drill before driving
the screw in, to prevent splitting the wood.</p>

<p>After the base piece is fastened to the
stack, the base in turn is held to the deck
of the boat by two small screws driven up
from beneath. The guy-wires can then be
fastened on. The guy-wires should be made
of very fine wire, since heavy wire would be
entirely out of proportion. The wire can
be fastened on the stack by drilling a tiny
hole through the stack. A knot is then tied
in one end of the wire, and the opposite end
threaded through the hole. Small screw-eyes
driven into the base piece are used to
anchor the guy-wires.</p>

<p>Ventilators are a very important part of
the boat. The model-builder will encounter
considerable trouble if he attempts to make
his cowl-ventilator from metal, unless he is
very experienced in drawing copper out by
hand. The writer has found a method of
producing cowl-ventilators by the use of clay
pipes. Clay pipes can be purchased for a
few cents each, and when cut down as shown
in <a href="#fig_96">Fig. 96</a> they form very suitable ventilators.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
The pipe can be cut as shown by the
use of a file. The ventilator is held to the
deck of the boat by being forced into a hole
in the deck that is just a trifle under size.
Of course, the forcing will have to be done
carefully to prevent the stem from cracking.
The inside of the ventilator should always
be painted red, and the outside should be the
same color as the boat. Ventilators made in
this way absolutely defy detection and do
much toward bettering the general appearance
of the craft upon which they are used.</p>

<img src="images/i_127.png" width="280" height="350" alt="Fig. 98" title="" />

</div>



<p>A simple searchlight, easily made by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
model boat builder, is shown in <a href="#fig_97">Fig. 97</a>.
This is an electric light, and the batteries
used to propel the boat can be used for the
light. First a small circular piece of wood
is cut out, as shown at <i>A</i>, <a href="#fig_97">Fig. 97</a>. The
center of this is drilled out to accommodate
a small flashlight bulb. A tiny brass screw
is then driven into the piece of wood, so that
it will come in contact with the center of the
base of the flashlight bulb. This little screw
forms one of the electrical contacts, and one
of the wires from the battery is attached to
it.</p>

<p>A little strip of brass is then cut as shown
in <i>B</i>, <a href="#fig_97">Fig. 97</a>, and provided with three holes,
one hole at each end and one in the middle.
The brass is bent into a semicircular shape,
so that it will be just a little larger in diameter
than the outside of the wooden piece in
which the flashlight bulb is mounted. This
little piece is then fastened to a wooden post
with a small brass pin, as shown in <a href="#fig_97">Fig. 97</a>.
Two more pins are used to hold the wooden
piece to the searchlight proper. One of
these pins is driven through the wooden piece
until it comes in contact with the base of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
flashlight bulb. This forms the other electrical
connection, and the second feed wire
from the battery can be attached to the little
brass piece that holds the searchlight. Both
the feed wires from the battery can come
up through a hole in the deck close to the
wooden post upon which the searchlight is
mounted.</p>

<p>Bollards are very easily made. Reference
to <a href="#fig_98">Fig. 98</a> will make this clear. First a little
strip of brass is cut, and this is drilled as
shown with two holes, one at each end and
two smaller holes in the center. Two little
circular pieces of wood are then cut, with a
hole through the center. A brass screw
passes through these and into the deck of the
boat. The brass screw should not be
driven in too far, since the bollards should
be free to revolve. It is also possible to use
brass tubing instead of wood if the proper
size is in the model-builder's shop.</p>

<span class="caption">A POWERFUL GASOLENE BLOW-TORCH<br />For a metre racing boat. Such a torch will deliver a steady, hot flame forfifteen minutes</span>
</div>

<p>A word will be said here about finishing
the deck of a model boat. It is a very tedious
job to cut separate planks to form the
deck. In fact, this job is quite beyond the
ability, to say nothing of the patience, of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
average young model-builder. A very
simple method of producing imitation planking
is shown in <a href="#fig_99">Fig. 99</a>. A sharp knife and
a straight-edge are the only tools for this
work. The straight-edge is merely used to
guide the knife. The cuts should not be
made too deep, and they should be made a
uniform distance apart. When the deck is
finished in this manner and varnished over,
a very pleasing effect is produced. In fact,
if the work is done carefully, the deck looks
very much as if it were planked.</p>

</div>

<p>A small life-boat is shown in <a href="#fig_100">Fig. 100</a>.
This can easily be carved to shape from a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
small piece of soft white pine. The center
is gouged out, and tiny little seats made of
thin strips of wood are glued in place. Two
small screw-eyes are placed in the boat, for
fastening it to the davits. The davits are
shown in <a href="#fig_101">Fig. 101</a>, at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. They are
made by bending a piece of small brass rod,
as shown. One end of the rod is hammered
flat, and a hole is made in it with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
very small drill. Holes a little under size
are drilled in the deck, and the davits are
forced into these. The method of suspending
the life-boat from the davits is shown at
<i>B</i>, <a href="#fig_101">Fig. 101</a>. The little blocks of wood are
glued on to a thread to represent pulleys, and
they are, of course, only imitation or dummy
pulleys.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a name="fig_102" id="fig_102"></a>
<img src="images/i_134.png" width="300" height="189" alt="Fig. 102" title="" />
</div>

<p>The method of producing port-holes is
shown in <a href="#fig_102">Fig. 102</a>. A hole is first bored
through the wood with a bit of the proper
size. The size of the port-holes depends entirely
upon the size of the boat. A piece of
brass tubing is then cut off with a hacksaw
to form a brass bushing. The outside diameter
of this tubing should be the same as
the size of the bit used. For instance, if a
<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>-inch bit is used, brass tubing <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
diameter should be purchased. Such tubing
can be obtained from any hardware store.
Celluloid, such as that used for windows in
automobile curtains, is glued to the inside of
the port-holes. This makes a splendid substitute
for glass. It can be obtained at
garages and automobile supply stores for a
few cents a square foot. The model boat
builder can also use either mica or glass for
this purpose, although thick glass looks
somewhat out of place.</p>

<p>A binnacle is shown in <a href="#fig_103">Fig. 103</a>. This is
made from a solid piece of
wood cut with a semi-spherical
top. The steering-wheel
is made of a wheel
from an old alarm clock.
The teeth of the wheel
should be filed off. Tiny pieces of wire are
then soldered in place on the wheel, as
shown. A pin driven through the center of
the steering-wheel is used to fasten it to the
binnacle. The binnacle itself can be held to
the deck either by glue or by a small screw.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 177px;"><a name="fig_103" id="fig_103"></a>
<img src="images/i_135.png" width="177" height="175" alt="Fig. 103" title="" />
</div>

<p>A torpedo-tube for use on model destroyers
and battleships is shown in <a href="#fig_104">Fig. 104</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
First two disks of wood are cut. Then a circular
piece is cut, as shown. Two brass
nails are then driven through this piece into
one of the disks. An upholstering tack is
driven into the end of the circular piece, as
pictured. The method of attaching the
torpedo-tube to the deck is clearly illustrated
in <a href="#fig_104">Fig. 104</a> and no further directions need
be given. If the model-builder has a small
piece of brass tube on hand suitable for use
in this case, it will make a much better appearing
tube than the piece of wood illustrated.</p>

<p>A wireless antenna is shown at <a href="#fig_105">Fig. 105</a>.
This is a fitting that will do much toward
improving the appearance of any craft.
Very fine copper wire is used for the a&euml;rial.
The little spreaders are cut to shape from
wood, and a tiny hole is punched through
them through which the wire is placed.
Black beads slipped on the wire serve very
well as insulators. The lead-in wire which
drops to the wireless cabin is attached to the
a&euml;rial by winding it around each one of the
a&euml;rial waves. The a&euml;rial should be suspended
between the masts of the vessel. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
few words should be said about masts in general.
If there is one way in which a model-builder
can destroy the appearance of a
model boat, it is by using badly proportioned
masts. The average boy seems inclined
to use a mast of too great a diameter,
which makes it out of proportion with the
rest of the boat. It is better to have a mast
too small rather than too large.</p>

<p>The method of producing railing is shown
in <a href="#fig_106">Fig. 106</a>. The same small brass rod that
was used for the davits can be used for the
rail stanchions. One end of the stanchions
is hammered flat and drilled out. The
stanchions are fastened to the deck by first
drilling small holes and forcing them into
it. Thread or very fine wire is used for the
railing. Fine wire is preferred owing to the
fact that it will not break so easily under
strain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;"><a name="fig_105" id="fig_105"></a><a name="fig_106" id="fig_106"></a><a name="fig_107" id="fig_107"></a><a name="fig_108" id="fig_108"></a><a name="fig_109" id="fig_109"></a><a name="fig_110" id="fig_110"></a>
<img src="images/i_138.png" width="475" height="563" alt="Fig. 105" title="" />
</div>

<p>Fig. 107 shows a good method of producing
stairs. It must be remembered that
stairs are often used in model-boat construction.
First a strip of tin is bent as shown.
Then two more strips, which act as side
pieces, are cut. One of these strips is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
soldered to each side of the stairs. Then
six stanchions, which can be made from
heavy copper wire, are soldered to the side
pieces, as shown. The railing can be made
from copper wire or black thread.</p>

<p>Fig. 108 shows a small skylight placed on
the deck. This is easily made from cigar-box-wood
glued together. The holes in the
top pieces for the windows are cut with a
very sharp knife. It will be necessary to
use a little patience in this, to prevent the
piece from splitting and to prevent cracks.
A piece of celluloid is glued underneath the
top pieces before they are finally glued in
place.</p>

<p>A small quick-firing deck-gun is shown in
<a href="#fig_109">Fig. 109</a>. This is a very simple fitting and
can be made with very little difficulty. The
base of the gun is formed by cutting a
thread-spool in half. A piece of small brass
tubing is used to form the barrel. A little
piece of sheet tin is looped over the back of
the gun to represent the breech. A tiny
piece of wire is held to the side of the breech
with a drop of solder, to represent a handle.
The shield of the gun is cut from a piece of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
tin, as shown. A hole is made in the bottom
of this, so that the nail that passes
through the barrel of the gun will also pass
through this hole and into the spool. The
center of the spool should be plugged to hold
the nail. After the gun is painted gray or
black it will appear very businesslike, considering
the small amount of labor spent in
producing it.</p>

<p>Anchors are more or less difficult to make
(Fig. 110), and unless the builder is endowed
with a great amount of patience he
will not be able to file them out of solid metal.
A dummy anchor can be easily cut out of
wood, however, and when painted black it
will answer instead of a metal one. The
anchor shown at <i>A</i> is a very simple type
made out of a solid piece of wood. The one
at <i>B</i>, however, is made out of two pieces of
wood fastened together with a pin, as shown.
The bottom piece of the anchor shown at <i>B</i>
should be rather thick to get the proper effect,
and the two points should be tapered
nicely. The center of the bottom piece
should be hollowed out to accommodate the
vertical piece.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>A common hatch is shown at <a href="#fig_111">Fig. 111</a>.
This can be made in the form of an open box
from cigar-box wood, and glued to the deck.
It is not necessary to cut a hole in the deck
for this purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;"><a name="fig_111" id="fig_111"></a><a name="fig_113" id="fig_113"></a><a name="fig_115" id="fig_115"></a><a name="fig_116" id="fig_116"></a>

</div>



<p>A cargo-hoist for use on model freight-boats
is shown in <a href="#fig_112">Fig. 112</a>. This is a
very simple piece of work and will need
little description. Several stay-wires should
be fastened to the main-mast and held to the
deck with small screw-eyes. The boom
should be made a trifle smaller in diameter
than the mast. The pulleys are dummy, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
those on the life-boat. A little hook bent to
shape from copper wire is placed on the end
of the thread, as shown.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 185px;"><a name="fig_112" id="fig_112"></a>

</div>


<p>Fig. 113 shows a method of making a
whistle and an engine exhaust. The engine
exhaust is made of a piece of wood, and the
furled top is produced by an eyelet such as
those used in shoes. The engine exhaust is
always placed immediately back of the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
smokestack. The whistle is a simple device
made almost entirely of wood. The whistle-cord
is of thread attached to the small piece
of wire, as shown.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a name="fig_114" id="fig_114"></a>
<img src="images/i_142b.png" width="300" height="212" alt="Fig. 114" title="" />
</div>

<p>Fig. 114 shows the method of making
spray-cloths for the top of the pilot-house.
Small brass brads are driven into the top of
the pilot-house, and white adhesive tape is
placed on the brads, as pictured. Advantage
can be taken of the adhesive substance
on the tape which holds it in place on the
brads.</p>

<p>A rudder is shown in <a href="#fig_115">Fig. 115</a>. The
rudder-post should be a piece of brass rod
so thick that it can be split with a hacksaw.
The sheet brass that forms the rudder
proper is placed in this split and soldered.
In the case of an ornamental boat the rudder
can be fixed as shown in <a href="#fig_115">Fig. 115</a>. It
will be seen that it is quite impossible to keep
the rudder in adjustment in this way.</p>

<p>If the rudder is to be kept in a certain adjustment
a quadrant is necessary. This is
made by using a semicircular piece of heavy
sheet brass and filing little notches in it.
The lever of the rudder rests in these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
notches, and by this means the rudder can
be held in any one position, so that the boat
will either turn in a circle or go straight.
<a href="#fig_116">Fig. 116</a> illustrates such an arrangement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE DESIGN OF MODEL STEAM-ENGINES</h3>


<div class='cap'>INSTEAD of describing the construction
of several model engines of different design,
the author thinks it advisable to put
the reader in possession of the fundamentals
of model steam-engine design and construction.
In this way the model engineer will be
able to design and construct model steam-engines
according to his own ideas and in
accordance with the raw materials and miscellaneous
parts he may find in his workshop.
Unless the young mechanic is in possession
of a very well equipped workshop, it is quite
impossible to construct a steam-engine according
to certain specifications. However,
if he has in mind the fundamental principles
of steam-engine design, he can go ahead and
design his engine, for which he will have
no trouble in machining or producing the
parts that enter into its construction. By<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
this the author means that the workman can
design his engine to meet the materials he
has on hand.</div>

<p>Notice <a href="#fig_117">Fig. 117</a>. This is a cylinder into
which is fitted a piston. If steam is forced
into the cylinder the piston
will be forced to the opposite
end of the cylinder. If some
means is then provided so that
the steam can escape and the
piston come back, another impulse
can be given it by admitting
more steam, and thus a continuous motion
may be produced. This is how the
steam-engine works.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 220px;"><a name="fig_117" id="fig_117"></a>
<img src="images/i_146.png" width="220" height="300" alt="Fig. 117" title="" />
</div>

<p>Having learned how motion is imparted
to the piston by the expansion of steam under
pressure, attention is directed to what is
known as the "D" slide-valve. This slide-valve
permits steam to enter the cylinder and
to exhaust at proper intervals. See <a href="#fig_118">Fig. 118</a>.
Steam enters the steam-chest through the
pipe <i>A</i>. The slide-valve is shown at <i>D</i>.
When the slide-valve is in the position
shown, steam enters the cylinder, and by the
time the cylinder has arrived in the position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
shown by the dotted line <i>C</i>, the slide-valve
moves over, closing the passage <i>B</i>. The
steam under pressure forces the piston to
the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'oppositite'">opposite</ins> end of the cylinder. When
the piston reaches the opposite end of the
cylinder, steam that has entered through the
passage <i>F</i> again forces the piston back to
its original position. This is caused by the
slide-valve shifting its position, because of
the impulse it received at the opposite end
of the cylinder. Thus it will be seen that
when the piston is at one end of the cylinder
the opposite end is exhausting. By carefully
studying <a href="#fig_118">Fig. 118</a> the action of the <i>D</i> valve
will be understood. The connecting-rod <i>E</i>
is connected to the crankshaft and in this
way the engine is caused to revolve.</p>

</div>

<p>A cylinder similar to that shown in <a href="#fig_118">Fig. 118</a>
 is called a double-acting cylinder. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
is because the steam acts on both sides of the
piston. Single-acting cylinders are cylinders
in which the steam expands on only
one side of the piston. In the single-acting
engines the <i>D</i> valve is modified.</p>

<p>The "stroke" of a steam-engine depends
upon the length of the cylinder; really, the
stroke is the distance travelled by the piston.
In model engines it ranges from <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> of
an inch to 1<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches. The bore of a cylinder
is its internal diameter. The bore is usually
a trifle smaller than the stroke. Thus it is
common to have a stroke of <span class='frac'><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch and a
cylinder-bore of <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch.</p>

<p>At this juncture the author would caution
the more inexperienced young mechanics not
to build double-acting engines. The valve
mechanism is somewhat intricate and very
difficult to regulate. The construction is
also much more complicated, and this also
holds true of the designing. On the other
hand, single-acting engines, while not so
powerful for a given size, will do very
nicely in driving model boats, and will deliver
sufficient power for all ordinary purposes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;"><a name="fig_119" id="fig_119"></a>
<img src="images/i_149.png" width="475" height="357" alt="Fig. 119" title="" />
</div>

<p>Your attention is directed to <a href="#fig_119">Fig. 119</a>.
This shows a design for a model single-cylinder,
single-acting steam-engine. The
reader should carefully study each drawing
before continuing to digest the following
matter. The cylinder <i>L</i> can be made from
a piece of tubing. This can be either brass
or copper. Aluminum should not be used,
owing to the fact that it is difficult to solder
and difficult to work with. The piston is
made so that it will fit nicely into the cylinder
and move up and down without binding.
It will be seen that a groove, <i>M</i>, is cut around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the piston near the top. String soaked in oil
is placed in this groove. This is called packing,
and the presence of this packing prevents
steam leakage between the piston and
the cylinder walls and thereby materially increases
the efficiency of the engine.</p>

<p>In this case the connecting-rod <i>R</i> is made
in a circular piece. It is attached to the piston
by a pin, <i>F</i>. The connecting-rod must
be free to revolve upon this pin. The engine
shown has a stroke of <span class='frac'><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch. Therefore,
the crank-pin <i>K</i> on the crank-disk <i>N</i> must
be placed <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> of <span class='frac'><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> or <span class='frac'><sup>7</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> inch from the
center of the disk <ins title="Transcriber's Note: not italicized in the original text"><i>N</i></ins>, so that when this disk
makes one revolution, the piston will move
<span class='frac'><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch in the cycle. Thus it will be seen that
the distance of the crank-pin <i>K</i> from the
center of the crank disk <i>N</i> will depend entirely
upon the stroke of the engine. It may
be well to mention here that the worker
should always start designing his engine by
first determining the bore and stroke.
Everything depends upon these two factors.
It is also well to mention here that the piston
should never travel completely to the top
of the cylinder&mdash;a small space must always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
be left for the steam to expand. One eighth
of an inch is plenty of space to leave.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the valve mechanisms
on the particular engine shown bear no
resemblance to the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: not italicized in the original text"><i>D</i></ins> valve previously described.
The holes <i>G</i> which are bored
around the cylinder are the exhaust ports.
It will be seen that when the piston is at
the end of its downward stroke it uncovers
these exhaust ports and permits the steam
to escape. The momentum of the flywheel
<i>A</i> pushes the piston upward, closing these
holes. As these holes are closed the valve
<i>H</i> uncovers the entrance <i>I</i> and permits steam
to enter from the boiler through <i>J</i>. By the
time the piston has reached the upward limit
of its stroke a considerable steam pressure
has developed on top of the cylinder, and this
again forces the piston downward. Thus
the same cycle of movement is gone through
repeatedly.</p>

<p>The valve on this little engine is extremely
simple. It consists of a circular piece of
brass drilled out, as shown. A hole (<i>I</i> and
<i>J</i>) is drilled transversely through this. The
little cylinder shown in the insert at <i>O</i> slides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
in the larger hole, and when it is at its upper
limit it cuts off the steam. At the proper
intervals the valve is pulled down by the
eccentric <i>C</i>. It will be seen that the moving
parts, i.e., the valve and the piston, must
be properly timed. That is, the eccentric <i>C</i>
must be mounted on the crank-shaft <i>B</i> so
that the valve will close and open at proper
intervals. When the engine is made, the eccentric
can be shifted about by means of a
set-screw, <i>Q</i>, until the engine operates satisfactorily.
This set-screw is used to hold the
eccentric to the crank-shaft. The word eccentric
merely means "off center." Thus
the eccentric in this case is formed by a little
disk of brass with the hole drilled off center.
The distances these holes are placed off center
will depend entirely upon the motion of
the valve. It will be seen that the valve is
connected to the eccentric by means of the
valve-rod <i>E</i>. The valve-rod, in turn, is held
to a circular strap which is placed around
the eccentric. A groove should be cut in
the surface of the eccentric, so that this
strap will not slip off. If the strap is not
put on too tightly and the eccentric is free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to revolve within it, the valve will be forced
up and down as the eccentric revolves.</p>

<p>The crank-shaft <i>B</i> revolves in two bearings,
<i>D D</i>. The flywheel is held to the
crank-shaft by means of a set-screw <i>S</i>.</p>

<p>Most small engines with a bore under one
inch will operate nicely on from 20 to 30
pounds of steam, and this pressure can easily
be generated in the boiler that was described
in the chapter on model-boat power plants.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>A MODEL FLOATING DRY-DOCK</h3>


<div class='cap'>AS many of the readers probably know,
a dry-dock is used in assisting disabled
vessels. Some dry-docks are permanent,
while others are built so that they
can be floated or towed to a disabled vessel
that is not able to get to a land dry-dock.
The land dry-dock operates as follows. It
is first filled with water, and the disabled
boat is towed in by tugs. After the tugs
leave, the gates are closed, and the water in
the dry-dock is pumped out, leaving the boat
high and dry. Large props are put in place
to prevent the boat from tipping.</div>

<p>The dry-dock here described is a model
that is towed to a disabled vessel. It is then
sunk until it passes under the boat. The
sinking is brought about by filling the dry-dock
with water. After it has sunk to the
proper depth it is passed under the boat to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
be repaired, the water is pumped out, and
the dry-dock rises, lifting the disabled boat
with it. Repairs can then be made very
easily.</p>

<p>The model here described does not possess
all the fittings and additions of the original.
However, it is able to rise or sink as required,
carrying the machinery necessary to
bring about these functions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="fig_120" id="fig_120"></a><a name="fig_121" id="fig_121"></a>
<img src="images/i_155.png" width="450" height="269" alt="Fig. 120" title="" />
</div>


<p>A general view of the completed model is
shown in <a href="#fig_120">Fig. 120</a>. The first part to construct
is the framework for the hull. Four
pieces of wood will be required for this,
and they should be cut to the shape and size
shown in <a href="#fig_121">Fig. 121</a>. To make this it is best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
to cut the two side parts first, as indicated
by the dotted lines. This done, the bottom
piece can be clamped on from behind by
means of pieces of lath. These are for the
two end pieces. The other two pieces are
made in the same way, except that they contain
holes for the water to pass through, as
shown at <i>B</i>. The wood for these frames,
or ribs, should be not less than <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch thick
in order to accommodate the pieces used in
the construction of the remainder of the
hull.</p>

<p>When the builder has made the four ribs,
he should proceed to construct the lower
deck, which consists of a single piece of wood
nicely planed and finished, measuring 14<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>
inches long by 8 inches wide and <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch
thick. This piece must be nailed to the bottom
of each of the ribs, one at each end, and
the other two containing the holes at equal
distances apart. Tiny nails, similar to those
used on cigar-boxes, will be found very suitable
for this work. Some old cigar-boxes
may be broken apart to obtain the nails for
this purpose. Before nailing on the board it
should be marked out to present ordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
deck-boards. The reader is referred back
to Chapter 9 which describes this process,
using a straight-edge and knife.</p>

<p>When this board is nailed in place, the
next requirement will be two pieces for the
sides the bottom edges, of which must rest
on the top of the deck-board. These boards
are the same length as the deck. They
should reach to the top of the ribs, and be
fastened in the same way as the bottom deck.
It is good practice, when doing this, to place
a little white lead on the bottom edge before
finally driving the nails in place. This will
tend to produce a water-tight joint. This
done, three pieces of wood <span class='frac'><sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch square
must be screwed in place, flush with the bottom
ends of the ribs, to form a flat keel.
They should be firmly fixed since a lead keel
is afterward screwed on the bottom of the
boat. Attention should now be directed to
fitting the two middle decks. These are
placed 4 inches from the top and are 4 inches
wide. In this space the engine and pumps
are placed. Therefore, the top deck is made
in the form of a lid, and the outside plate
made to draw out. In this way the mechanism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
below the deck can be made very accessible.</p>

<p>The framework of the dry-dock is now
completed, and the builder can proceed to fix
on the side plates. These are made from
sheet tin with a width of 14<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches. The
length must be sufficient to reach from the
top of one side, around the bottom of the
hull, to the top of the other side. Having
cut the tin to the required size, one side is
put in place with small nails, spacing them
an equal distance apart.</p>

<p>Before securing the opposite side, the
builder must first arrange the inlet-valve.
This particular member is constructed as follows.
First, obtain an old gas-pipe union
which measures about <span class='frac'><sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch in diameter
and <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch long. With a hacksaw this is cut
off in a sloping direction with an angle to
correspond with the slope in the bottom of
the dry-dock. When this is done, a lid must
be fitted to the top by means of a long rod,
as clearly shown in <a href="#fig_122">Fig. 122</a>. On the under
side of this lid a small piece of sheet rubber
should be glued, so that when the lid is
screwed down the valve will be made water-tight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
The valve must now be soldered to
the inside of the hull. It is placed in such a
position that it will rest just under
the center of one of the upper
decks when the controlling
rod is upright.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 120px;"><a name="fig_122" id="fig_122"></a>
<img src="images/i_159.png" width="120" height="300" alt="Fig. 122" title="" />
</div>

<p>The top end of the rod must
contain a thread for about 1 inch,
and a round plate made to screw
on. This plate should be about
<span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch in diameter, and contain
three small holes around the
edge. These holes are used in fastening
the plate to the deck. The top of the rod
is fitted with a small crank-handle, which is
used in turning the rod in either direction.
In this way the valve can be either opened
or closed. At the bottom of the rod a small
swivel should be provided, as indicated in
<a href="#fig_122">Fig. 122</a>.</p>

<p>The plate or sheet of tin on this side of
the hull can now be permanently fixed in
place. When this is done a light hammer
should be used around the edges to turn the
tin into the wood.</p>

<p>With the plates secured in place, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
builder must next fix a flat wood keel along
the bottom of the dry-dock. This should
be screwed to the inside keel, screws passing
through the tin plate. A lead keel is then
screwed to the wooden keel, and when this
is done the dry-dock can be launched. If
the foregoing instructions have been carried
out carefully the dry-dock should ride lightly
on the water.</p>

<p>As a trial the inlet-valve is now unscrewed
and water is permitted to enter the hull.
When the water rushes in, the hull will begin
to sink. The water should be allowed
to enter until the hull sinks to within an inch
of the lower or inside deck. The valve
should then be closed. The exact position
of the water should now be found, and a line
drawn all around the hull, which can afterward
be painted in.</p>

<p>The engine and boilers must now be constructed
and placed on the dry-dock, so that
the water that was permitted to enter may be
pumped out. As a temporary arrangement,
a thin rubber tubing is inserted through a
hole in the lower deck and allowed to hang
outside the water-level. The siphon can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
then be formed by simply drawing the water
up by suction with the lips. A continuous
flow will result, emptying the hull within a
short time.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 325px;"><a name="fig_123" id="fig_123"></a>
<img src="images/i_161.png" width="325" height="255" alt="Fig. 123" title="" />
</div>

<p>Attention is now directed to the construction
of the boiler and pumps. The boiler,
which is rectangular in shape, is made of
thin sheet copper, and measures 4 inches
long by 3 inches wide by 2 inches deep. A
hole is made in the top, and a brass or copper
tube 6 inches long and about <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch in diameter
is soldered in position, as depicted in
<a href="#fig_123">Fig. 123</a>. This tube acts as a chimney on
the dry-dock, but it is really used for filling
the boiler, and the top is supplied with a
tightly fitting cork.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The ends of the boiler also act as supports,
and they are made 4 inches long. The
bottom edge is turned up for about <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch
to enable the boiler to be screwed firmly to
the lower deck. The boiler occupies a position
at one end of the hull, and should fit
easily in between decks. A small spirit-lamp
is used to furnish heat, and no description
need be given of this particular part of
the equipment. Before the boiler is firmly
fixed in place a small hole should be made
near the top at one end. The feed steam-pipe
is inserted in this, and soldered in place.</p>

<p>Two small oscillating cylinders, similar to
those made for the engine on the <i>Nancy Lee</i>
(Chapter 6), should be made. They should
not be more than <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch in length, with a <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch
bore. If the builder has any old model
steam-engines in the shop, he may take the
cylinders from them instead of constructing
new ones for the dry-dock.</p>

<p>The engine is set up as shown in <a href="#fig_124">Fig. 124</a>.
The first job is to make the frame or standards,
and this is in one piece. Two pieces
of brass (<i>A</i>), measuring 5<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches long by
<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch wide and <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> inch in thickness, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
cut. Next the builder should mark off 1<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>
inches from either end, and carefully bend
at right angles, after which holes are drilled
to accommodate the crank-axle <i>B</i>. Two
holes must also be made for screws to enable
the machine to be screwed to the deck.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 325px;"><a name="fig_124" id="fig_124"></a><a name="fig_125" id="fig_125"></a>
<img src="images/i_163.png" width="325" height="173" alt="Fig. 124" title="" />
</div>


<p>The flywheel should be 1<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches in diameter,
while the bent crank has a throw of
<span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> inch. The steam-cylinder is fixed on the
outside of one of the uprights, and the steam-pipe
must, of course, be fitted from the inside.</p>

<p>The pump-cylinder is composed of a small
piece of brass tube 1 inch long and <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch in
diameter. The plunger is <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch long, and
the diameter is just sufficient to enable it to
work freely up and down inside the brass
tube. One end is shaped as shown in <a href="#fig_125">Fig. 125</a>
. This contains a saw cut that enables<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the pump-rod to be placed between and connected
with a pin. The bottom end of the
cylinder is now fitted with a brass disk in
which a hole is made and a <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>32</sub></span>-inch tube
soldered in place. The inside surface of
this piece of brass should be countersunk,
and the piece is then soldered into the end of
the cylinder. Before the plunger is inserted
a small lead shot is dropped in, which should
be larger than the hole at the bottom of the
cylinder, thereby covering it. A hole is
drilled in at the side of the cylinder, and a
small bent pipe fixed in it. At the top of
this pipe a short piece of <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch brass tube
is fixed in place, as indicated. This piece
of tubing is closed at both ends. The bottom
end is treated like that of the pump-barrel
and supplied with a large shot. An outlet-pipe
is soldered into the side of the delivery-valve
chamber and leads to the side of the
hull.</p>

<p>The pump <i>E</i> is fixed at the bottom midway
between the engine uprights as indicated
in <a href="#fig_124">Fig. 124</a>. The suction-pipe passes
through a hole and down through the deck
nearly to the bottom of the hull. After the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
engine and boiler are connected, a trial can
be made. If the foregoing instructions
have been carried out, the engine will run
at a good speed and a continuous flow of
water will be pumped out of the hull. All
parts of the engine and pump should be carefully
oiled and water should be poured into
the pump in order to prime it before its
start.</p>

<p>It is understood that two complete boilers
and pump units are made for the model, and
one is mounted on each side. If the builder
desires to increase the capacity of the pumps
and install a more powerful boiler and engine,
only one pump will be necessary.
Otherwise the water will not be pumped
from the hull very rapidly.</p>

<p>When the builder has finished the pump
units, he should turn his attention to the remainder
of the fittings. Two small cranes
are made, and one is placed at each side of
the hull. They are made of tin. The cab
of each crane measures 2<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches high by
2 inches long by 1<span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches wide. A small
roof is fitted on, and a piece of wood fitted
to the bottom to serve as a floor. The jib<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
measures 6 inches long by <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch at the base,
and tapers to <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch. It has <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch turned
down at each side, thus adding considerable
strength. The jib is fitted to the cab by
means of a wire passed through the sides,
and two guy-ropes are arranged as shown.
A small piece is now cut out at the top, and
a pulley wheel fixed in position by means of
a pin passed through the sides.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 275px;"><a name="fig_126" id="fig_126"></a>
<img src="images/i_166.png" width="275" height="189" alt="Fig. 126" title="" />
</div>

<p>The winding-drum can be made of either
tin or wood. The axle passes through both
sides of the cab, the crank being attached
to the outside. <a href="#fig_126">Fig. 126</a> shows the completed
crane, which is held to the deck by
means of a small bolt and nut. A washer
should be placed between the bottom of the
crane and the deck, to allow the crane to
turn freely with little friction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>A hand-rail, made of fine brass wire, is
placed around the deck.</p>

<p>Dummy port-holes are fixed to the sides
of the dry-dock for the purpose of lighting
up the interior of the engine-room. These
are furnished from top rings taken from
gas-mantles. Anchor-chains are fixed at
each end of the dry-dock. The whole dry-dock
is painted with two coats of gray paint
and the water-line painted in bright red.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>OPERATION OF FLASH STEAM POWER PLANTS FOR MODEL BOATS</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE flash steam method of propelling
model power boats of the racing type
produces a far greater speed than would
otherwise be possible. Flash steam plants
are far more complicated than ordinary
steam-propelled power plants, and for this
reason the author devotes a chapter to their
description.</div>

<p>A considerable equipment of tools and not
a little mechanical ingenuity are required to
produce and assemble a workable flash steam
plant. However, such plants have gained
great popularity in the past few years, and
all of the hydroplane racing craft are propelled
with such outfits. These power
plants are capable of delivering such a tremendous
power that speeds as high as thirty-five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
miles an hour have been reached by boats
measuring 40 inches long.</p>

<p>The illustration, <a href="#fig_128">Fig. 128</a>, shows a flash
steam plant and its various parts. Each
part and its function will be described in
this Chapter in detail. The gasolene tank <i>A</i>
is used to hold the fuel, which is fed to the
gasolene burner <i>C</i>. The gasolene burner
operates on the principle of the ordinary
gasolene torch. First the tank is filled about
three-quarters full with gasolene. An air-pressure
is then produced in the tank with a
bicycle pump. The pipe leading from the
gasolene-tank at the top is coiled around the
burner, and the free end of it is bent and
provided with a nipple, so that the gasolene
vapor will be blown through the center of
the helix of the coil formed by the pipe bent
around the burner. This is quite clearly
shown in the drawing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="fig_128" id="fig_128"></a>
<img src="images/i_170.png" width="550" height="339" alt="Fig. 128" title="" />
</div>

<p>The cylinder is merely a piece of stovepipe
iron bent to shape and provided with several
air-holes at the burner end. To start the
burner, the vaporizing coils must first be
heated in an auxiliary flame. The flame of
an ordinary blow-torch is suitable for this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
purpose. After the coils have become sufficiently
hot the valve at the top of the gasolene-tank
is opened, and this causes a stream
of gasolene vapor to issue at the nipple.
This produces a hot flame at the center of
the vaporizing coils, and in this way the coils
are kept hot. The purpose of heating these
coils is further to vaporize the gasolene as
it passes through them on the way to the
burner. Once started, the action of the
burner is entirely automatic. The vaporizing
coils are made of Shelby steel tubing
with an internal diameter of <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the flame from the
gasolene-torch is blown through the center
of the boiler coils <i>B</i>. Thus, any water passing
through these boiler coils is instantly
converted into steam. In other words, the
water "flashes" into steam. The heat of the
blow-torch is so great that most of the boiler
coils are maintained at red heat even while
the water is passing through them.</p>

<p>Notice the water-tank <i>G</i>. A little scoop,
formed by a pipe of small diameter, protrudes
through the bottom of the boat, so
that the forward motion of the boat will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
cause water to rise in the tank <i>G</i>. An overflow
is also provided, so that, should the
water not be sucked out of the tank quickly
enough, it will not flood the boat. The
overflow pipe hangs off the side of the
boat.</p>

<p>The water pump <i>E</i> sucks water from the
tank, and pumps it through the check-valve
<i>K</i> (this valve permits water to pass in one
direction only) into the boiler coils. The
boiler coils, being red-hot, cause the water
to flash into steam the instant it reaches
them. By the time the steam has reached
the opposite end of the boiler coils, it is no
longer steam, but a hot, dry gas at a terrific
pressure. From the boiler coils the steam
passes into the steam-chest of the engine,
and thence into the cylinder, where it expands,
delivering its energy to the piston.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the water-pump <i>E</i> is
geared to the engine. Owing to this, it is
necessary to start the water circulating
through the boiler coils by the hand pump
<i>F</i>. This hand pump forces water through
the boiler coils just as the power pump does.
After the hand pump is started the engine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
is turned over a few times until it starts.
The valve <i>H</i> is then closed, which cuts the
starting pump <i>F</i> entirely out of the system,
because when the engine starts it also drives
the water pump <i>E</i>, and therefore the action
becomes entirely automatic.</p>

<p>The relief-cock <i>L</i> is placed in the system
to be used if the engine stalls. By opening
the relief-cock the pressure in the complete
system is immediately relieved. At all
other times the relief-cock is closed.</p>

<p>A second pump, <i>I</i>, is also included in the
system. This, like the water-pump, is
geared to the engine and driven by it. It is
the duty of this pump to convey oil from
the lubricating tank <i>M</i> into the steam feed-pipe
just before it enters the steam-chest.
In this way the live superheated steam
carries a certain amount of lubricating oil
with it in the cylinder.</p>

<p>Owing to the high temperature of the superheated
steam, it is impossible to use brass
cylinders on the steam-engines employed
with flash steam systems. Steel seems to be
the only cheap metal that is capable of withstanding
the attack of flash steam. Brass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
is out of the question, since its surface will
pit badly after it is in use a short time.</p>

<p>The boiler of a flash steam plant is
covered with sheet iron so as to prevent
drafts of air from deflecting the flame from
the center of the boiler coils. The cover is
provided with ventilators, so that the burner
will not be smothered. If enough oxygen
does not enter the interior of the boiler coils,
poor combustion will result, and the gasolene
flame will not develop its maximum
heat. Upon referring again to the diagram,
it will be seen that the exhaust steam pipe
from the engine discharges into the stack of
the boiler covering. This discharge greatly
facilitates the circulation of air through the
boiler coils.</p>

<p>After a flash steam plant has been started
it will work automatically, providing all the
parts are in good running order. Flash
steam plants, however, are difficult to get in
the proper adjustment, and once adjusted
they are easily disturbed by minor causes.
Owing to the fact that every square inch of
surface in the flash coils is heating surface,
the amount of water supplied to the boiler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
must be exactly what is needed. The heat
must also be regulated so that the temperature
of the steam will just meet the engine's
needs. Many times an increase in heat
causes the steam to reach such a temperature
that it will burn up the lubricating oil before
it reaches the cylinder of the engine. This
is liable to cause trouble, because sticking is
apt to occur.</p>

<p>Model power boats with speeds as high as
thirty-five miles an hour have been made in
America. Such high-speed boats must be
assembled with infinite care, owing to the
fact that the mechanism they carry is more
or less erratic in its action, and unless it is
well made results cannot be expected.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 271px;"><a name="fig_129" id="fig_129"></a>
<img src="images/i_176.png" width="271" height="275" alt="Fig. 129" title="" />
</div>

<p>There are probably few sports more interesting
than that of model power-boat racing.
The Central Park Model Yacht Club
of New York city is one of the most progressive
clubs in America, and its members
not only have a sail-boat division, but they
also have a power-boat division. The members
of the power-boat section have races
regularly once a week, and the most lively
competition is shown. It is indeed amusing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to watch these little high-speed boats
dash across the pond, their bows high in the
air and their little engines snorting frantically.
Owing to the difficulty of keeping
these small racing boats in a straight line,
they are tied to a wire or heavy cord and
allowed to race around a pole anchored in
the center of the pond, as illustrated in <a href="#fig_129">Fig. 129</a>
. The top of the pole should be provided
with a ball-bearing arranged so that
the cord to which the boat is fastened will
not wind around the post. In this way the
boats are caused to travel in a circle, and as
the cord to which they are fastened represents
the radius of the circle, the circumference
can readily be found by multiplying the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
radius by 2, which will give the diameter.
The diameter is then multiplied by 3.1416
to obtain the circumference. If the boats
were permitted to travel wild they would run
into the bank, a fatal procedure when they
are running at high speed.</p>

<p>Speed boat hulls are usually of the hydroplane
or sea-sled type. This type of hull is
extremely easy to make. Such a hull is
shown in <a href="#fig_130">Fig. 130</a>. It will be seen that it
has an aluminum bottom. The propeller
and propeller strut will be noticed in this illustration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="fig_130" id="fig_130"></a><a name="fig_131" id="fig_131"></a><a name="fig_132" id="fig_132"></a>
<img src="images/i_178.png" width="450" height="417" alt="Fig. 130" title="" />
</div>


<p>The drawing for the particular hull shown
in <a href="#fig_130">Fig. 130</a> is given in <a href="#fig_131">Fig. 131</a>. First the
two side pieces are cut out to the shape
shown. In this particular instance the
over-all length of the sides is 39<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> inches.
This is called a meter boat, and is built with
this length to conform with the English racing
rules. Next a bow piece is cut out, and
this is produced from solid wood. Only
two materials are used in the construction
of this hull, aluminum and mahogany.
Square mahogany strips are cut out and
fastened inside of the side pieces by means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of shellac and <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch brass brads. The
bottom of the hull is made of 22-gage sheet
aluminum. This is fastened to the square
mahogany strips, since the sides of the boat
are entirely too thin for this purpose. The
method of fastening the strips of aluminum
will be made evident by referring to <a href="#fig_132">Fig. 132</a>
. The aluminum bottom does not run
completely over the bow piece, but merely
overlaps it sufficiently to be fastened by brass
brads, as illustrated in <a href="#fig_135">Fig. 135</a>. The single<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
step in the bottom of the boat is fastened by
a mahogany strip, through which the stern-tube
runs and the water-scoop. The back
of the boat is made up of mahogany. A
small aluminum hood is bent to shape, and
this is fastened to the bow of the boat and
prevents the boat from shipping water.</p>

<p>In building a hull of this nature the mechanic
should exercise care to see that it is
in perfect balance, and that the sides are
finished and varnished as smoothly as possible.
This will cut down both air and water
resistance. The position of the propeller
strut and stern-tube will be seen by referring
to the drawing of the hull in <a href="#fig_131">Fig. 131</a>.</p>

<p>The propeller of a high-speed boat is of a
high pitch and generally of the two-blade
type. It should be at least 3 inches in diameter
and with a pitch of about 10 inches.
By this it is meant that the propeller theoretically
should advance 10 inches through the
water for one revolution. The rudder is
generally fastened in one position, in case
the boat is not used on a string and pole.
It will be found advisable, however, always
to run the boat in this way, and in such cases<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the rudder can be entirely dispensed with.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="fig_133" id="fig_133"></a>
<img src="images/i_180.png" width="450" height="137" alt="Fig. 133" title="" />
</div>

<p>The boiler of a flash steam plant is extremely
simple. Such a boiler is shown in
<a href="#fig_133">Fig. 133</a>. It consists merely of a coil of
copper or Shelby steel tubing with an internal
diameter of <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch. The boiler coils
should be wound around a circular form of
wood about 2<span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches in diameter. In the
case of copper it will not be found very
difficult to do this, providing the copper is
heated before being wound on the wooden
form. If the copper is heated it is advisable
to wind the wood with a layer of sheet asbestos
before the copper tube is wound on.
It is almost necessary to do this winding
with a lathe, but if the mechanic does not
have access to such a tool he may have to
find other means of doing it, or possibly he
can take it to a local machine shop and have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the work done for a few cents. The boiler
coil should be wound about 9 inches long.</p>

<p>A casing of Russian sheet iron is made
to slip over the boiler, leaving sufficient space
between. Ventilating holes or slots are cut
in the cover to permit of a free circulation
of air. The boiler covering is also provided
with a funnel through which the exhaust
gases from the blow-lamp pass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="fig_134" id="fig_134"></a><a name="fig_135" id="fig_135"></a>
<img src="images/i_181.png" width="450" height="159" alt="Fig. 134" title="" />
</div>


<p>The blow-lamp used operates on the same
principle as the ordinary blow-torch. The
details of such a lamp are given in <a href="#fig_134">Fig. 134</a>,
and a finished torch is shown in <a href="#fig_135">Fig. 135</a>.
Instead of making the valves necessary for
the blow-torch, it is advisable to purchase
them, for they are very difficult to make
accurately. The valve at the back of the
torch regulates the gasolene supply that
passes through the nipple. The hole in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
nipple should be about twenty thousandths
of an inch. Owing to the fact that the
copper coil wound about the burner is short,
the tube can be filled with molten resin before
it is bent. In this way the tube will not
kink or lose its shape while being wound.
After it is wound it is placed in the fire and
the molten resin forced out with a bicycle-pump.
Such a blow-torch produces a tremendous
heat and throws a hot flame far up
into the boiler coils.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>SAILING YACHTS</h3>


<div class='cap'>BEFORE attempting to construct model
sailing yachts the young worker should
become thoroughly conversant with the different
types of yachts and their fittings. In
the following pages the author briefly outlines
the general science of yacht-making
and sailing.</div>

<p>Sailing yachts are made in four principal
types. There is the cutter rig, yawl rig,
sloop rig, and the ketch rig. The cutter rig
is shown in <a href="#fig_136">Fig. 136</a>. It consists of four
sails so arranged that the top-sail may be
either removed altogether or replaced by
sails of smaller area. In all yachts it is
necessary to haul the sails up into position
by ropes known as halyards. The halyards
must be led down to the deck. The model-builder,
however, can dispense with much of
the gear used on larger boats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>A sloop rig is illustrated in <a href="#fig_137">Fig. 137</a>. By
studying the drawing the worker will see
that the sloop rig differs from the cutter rig
only in that she carries a single sail forward
of her mast.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig_136" id="fig_136"></a><a name="fig_137" id="fig_137"></a>
<img src="images/i_184.png" width="400" height="340" alt="Fig. 137" title="" />
</div>


<p>The yawl rig (See <a href="#fig_138">Fig. 138</a>) is similar to
a cutter rig, but has a small sail set up on
another mast abaft the mainsail. The sheet
is led aft to a spar that projects beyond the
counter. The mast upon which the smaller
sail is set is known as the mizzenmast. In
this rig it will be seen that the main boom
must be made considerably shorter than was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the case in the cutter rig. This is done so
that it will not follow the mizzenmast when
it swings from one position to another.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 195px;"><a name="fig_138" id="fig_138"></a><a name="fig_139" id="fig_139"></a>
<img src="images/i_185.png" width="195" height="325" alt="Fig. 138" title="" />
</div>


<p>The ketch rig differs greatly from the
yawl rig. The mizzenmast always occupies
a position forward of the rudder-post. In
the yawl the mizzenmast is always stepped
aft of the rudder-post. This will be seen by
referring to the drawings of the two boats.
The ketch rig is illustrated in <a href="#fig_139">Fig. 139</a>.</p>

<p>The prettiest rig of all is the schooner;
but, owing to the fact that it is difficult to
get them to go well to windward unless the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
hull is perfectly rigged, the author has decided
not to deal with this type of boat.
When the reader becomes proficient in building
and sailing the simpler types described
in this book, he may turn his attention to
the construction and sailing of more complicated
types.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Model Yacht Parts</i></div>

<p>The submerged portion of a yacht is, as
in all other boats, termed the hull. The
backbone of the hull is called the keelson.
Attached to the keelson is a piece of lead,
which is put in place to give the boat stability
and power to resist the heeling movement
created by the wind-pressure upon the
sails. This is known as the keel.</p>

<p>Yachts always have an opening in the
deck giving access to the interior of the hull.
These openings are known as hatchways.
When sailing in rough weather the hatchway
is closed by a hatch to prevent the yacht
from shipping water.</p>

<p>The extreme forward end of a yacht hull
is called the stern, while the portions forward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and aft of the midships section are
known as the fore and after-body respectively.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/engine.jpg" width="500" height="341" alt="A TWIN CYLINDER STEAM ENGINE FOR MODEL MARINE USE" title="" />
<span class="caption">A TWIN CYLINDER STEAM ENGINE FOR MODEL MARINE USE<br />
This engine will drive a boat several feet long</span>
</div>


<p>In all yachts a portion of the hull extends
out over the water. These portions are
known as overhangs. The overhang aft is
sometimes called the counter-stern. The
sides of the hull that rise above the deck are
called bulwarks, and the part of the bulwarks
that cross the stern is called the taffrail.
The taffrail is always pierced with
holes to allow water to run off the deck
quickly, so that the additional weight will
not in any way affect the course of the boat.
It is understood that yachts raise great quantities
of water upon their decks when traveling
in rough sea.</p>

<p>The bowsprit is passed through a ring at
the top of the stern, and this ring is termed
the gammon iron. Its end is secured in a
socket or between a pair of uprights called
the bowsprit bits. These are fixed to the
deck. Metal bars are fixed a short distance
above the deck to take rings attached to the
sheets. This is done so that the sails may
swing freely from one side of the boat to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
other. Metal eyes are screwed into the sides
to take the shrouds, and are called chain-plates.
The eye in the stern is called the
bobstay plate. In the stern-post are two
eyes called gudgeons. The rudder is hooked
to this by means of two hooks called pintles.
The bar or lever that is fixed to the top of
the rudder-post is called a tiller.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">

<span class="caption">A CUP-WINNING MODEL SAIL BOAT<br />

Central Park Model Yacht Club, New York, N. Y.</span>
</div>



<p>The parts and fittings of a mast follow:
the step, the head, the caps, crosstrees, truck,
topmast, boom, and gaff. The part of the
gaff that rests on the mast is called the
throat; the end of the gaff is called the peak.
The jib-boom is a term used only in connection
with model yachts. In larger boats the
jib-boom is an extension of the bowsprit.
The small boom that projects over the stern
of a yawl is called the bumpkin. The spar
is rather a general term applied to practically
all wooden supports of sails. The spar
of a lug-sail is called the yard. It is different
from a boom or gaff, by reason of its lying
against the mast instead of having one
end butting on the mast. Anything belonging
to the mainmast should be distinguished
by the prefix main. Thus, there are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
mainsail, the mainboom, main-topsail, etc.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 293px;"><a name="fig_140" id="fig_140"></a>
<img src="images/i_189.png" width="293" height="300" alt="Fig. 140" title="" />
</div>

<p>A sail for a model cutter-rigged yacht is
shown in <a href="#fig_140">Fig. 140</a>. The bowsprit and masts
are, when necessary, given support by ropes
that are stretched tightly to some point
where they can be conveniently anchored to
the hull. The following are those largely
used on model yachts: topmast stay, bobstay,
topmast shrouds, and forestay.</p>

<p>The sails are pulled up and fastened by
ropes termed halyards. The halyards are
fastened to the upper portions of the sail,
and they are named according to the sail to
which they are attached. For instance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
there is the jib halyard and the foresail halyard.
A mainsail carried by a gaff has two
halyards, the throat and peak. The movement
of the sails is controlled by ropes, called
sheets, which take their names from the
sails they control. There is a mainsheet, a
jibsheet, and a foresheet. The reader
should take note of this term and refrain
from confusing it with the sails.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Sailing Model Yachts</i></div>

<p>The sailing of model yachts is a real art,
and the author warns the reader that he cannot
hope to become a proficient yachtsman
by merely digesting the information given
in this book. His real knowledge must be
earned by experience in handling a model
yacht on the water. However, there are
few sports that will afford more pleasure
than that of sailing model yachts. Being
an outdoor sport it is very healthful.</p>

<p>In sailing a model yacht the sails are set,
or "trimmed," so that she will continue to
sail along the course previously decided upon
by the yachtsman. She must do this in as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
speedy a manner as possible and with as
little deviation from her original course as
possible. The trim of the sails will depend
upon the wind. If the boat is to sail against
the wind, that is termed "beating to windward";
with the wind is called "scudding."
With the wind sideways it is called "reaching."
If the boat is sailed with the wind
blowing midway between one of the sides
and the stern in such a way that it sweeps
from one side of the stern across the deck,
this is called "three-quarter sailing" in a
"quartering" wind. A model yacht will
continue for a great distance on a reach or
while scudding; but, on the other hand, it
will not be possible for her to sail directly
against the wind. If a yachtsman is to
make headway against the wind, he must
sail his boat as near dead against the wind
as it will go.</p>

<p>The cutter type of yacht will move against
a wind that is blowing at a very small angle
on her bowsprit. As soon as she reaches
the limit of her course, the yachtsman turns
her bow at a small angle so as to bring the
wind on the opposite side of the vessel, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in this way a second course is started.
These courses are repeated in a zigzag
fashion until the yacht arrives at her destination.
This zigzagging, or "tacking," as
it is called, is illustrated in <a href="#fig_141">Fig. 141</a>. It will
be seen that the yacht starts at <i>B</i>, and makes
3 tacks before she arrives at her destination,
<i>A</i>. Each time she touches the shore she is
"put about" and set upon a new course, or
"tack."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig_141" id="fig_141"></a>
<img src="images/i_192.png" width="400" height="138" alt="Fig. 141" title="" />
</div>

<p>It will be understood that tacking is slow
work, and a greater distance must be traveled
than would be covered by a power-boat,
which would be able to go in a straight line.
However, with wind-propelled craft this is
the only way in which progress can be made
against the wind. The left-hand side of a
yacht viewed from the stern is called the
port side, while the right-hand side is called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the starboard side. Thus a yacht sailing
with the wind blowing on her port side is on
the port tack, while if the wind is blowing
on the starboard side she is said to be on the
starboard tack. From this the reader will
see that <a href="#fig_142">Fig. 142</a> shows an impossible case.</p>

</div>


<p>The sails in front of the mast that are
placed nearest the stern of the yacht act in
such a manner as to turn the bows in the direction
of the arrow, as illustrated in Fig.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
146, and the sail or sails abaft the mast turn
the boat in the direction of the arrow <i>A</i>.
The boat thus revolves upon the center of
the mast much as a weathercock revolves
upon its pivot. If there is more than one
mast, all the sails carried abaft the mainmast
serve to turn the boat in the direction
<i>A</i>. The work of sailing depends greatly
upon the skill in balancing these two effects
so that the boat will progress in a straight
line. To do this the sails are set in a greater
or less angle in relation to the center line of
the boat. The less the angle that a sail
makes with the center line of the boat, the
greater is its power to determine in which
direction the boat will steer. The more the
yachtsman slackens out his jib and foresail,
or the smaller he makes these sails, the less
their power will be to turn the boat in the
direction <i>B</i>. On the other hand, the larger
they are and the more tightly they are pulled
in, the greater will be their power. When
the mainsail and all of the sails abaft the
mainsail are slackened out and the smaller
they are made, the less their power will be
to swing the boat in the direction <i>A</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>The influence of a sail upon the speed of
a boat also increases with the angle that it
makes with the center line of the hull. The
more the yachtsman slackens out his sail,
the more it will help the boat along. The
reader will see that these two conditions interfere
with each other, and therefore the
trimming of the sails becomes a compromise.
It is good for the young yachtsman to remember
to sail his boat with the sails as
slack as possible, as long as she keeps a good
course. He should also remember not to
overload her with sails, since the nearer to
an upright position she maintains the faster
she will go.</p>

<p>It is not possible to depend entirely upon
the trim of the sails to keep a model in a
given course. This is because the strength
of the wind varies so that the sails are in
balance one moment and out of balance the
next. The sails abaft the mainmast overpower
the sails before it when the wind increases.
The result of this is that the bow
of the boat will be repeatedly turned in the
direction <i>A</i>, <a href="#fig_146">Fig. 146</a>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 319px;"><a name="fig_146" id="fig_146"></a><a name="fig_147" id="fig_147"></a><a name="fig_148" id="fig_148"></a>
<img src="images/i_196.png" width="319" height="500" alt="Fig. 146" title="" />
</div>


<p>Some form of automatic rudder is therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
generally used to overcome this tendency
of the yacht to "luff" in the wind. <a href="#fig_147">Fig. 147</a>
 shows the course of a yacht reaching
from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>. The dotted lines show the
course she should follow. The full line
shows the effect of puffs of wind, which repeatedly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
take her out of her course. Many
times she may completely turn around and
make a similar course back to the starting-point,
as in <a href="#fig_148">Fig. 148</a>. There is also the
danger of her being taken back when pointing
directly against the wind&mdash;the wind will
force her backward stern first for some distance,
as illustrated in <a href="#fig_149">Fig. 149</a>. She will
do this until she manages to get around on
one tack or the other.</p>

<p>The dotted line <i>B</i> illustrates the course in
which she would be driven under these conditions.
It is not practical to sail a model
yacht dead before the wind without an automatic
rudder. With the use of an automatic
rudder the erratic movements shown
in <a href="#fig_148">Fig. 148</a> can be entirely overcome. The
action of the rudder is such that every time
the boat leans over to luff up into the wind,
the weight of the rudder causes it to swing
out, and thus prevents her from losing her
course. As a different type of rudder is required,
according to the course in which the
yacht is sailing, the weight should be adjustable
if the same rudder is used.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig_149" id="fig_149"></a><a name="fig_150" id="fig_150"></a><a name="fig_152" id="fig_152"></a>
<img src="images/i_198.png" width="500" height="371" alt="Fig. 149" title="" />
</div>


<p>Let us consider scudding before the wind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
For scudding the heaviest rudder should be
used, or the weight on a loaded tiller should
be in its position of maximum power. All
the sails abaft the foremast should be slackened
out as far as they will go, which will
bring the booms almost at right angles with
the center line of the boat. If the craft is
a cutter or yawl with a light weight, the
yachtsman should rig the spinnaker. The
head-sails may be left slack or can be tightened.
<a href="#fig_150">Fig. 150</a> shows the position of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
booms when scudding with a schooner and
yawl. The yawl is shown scudding goose winged.
The cutter is illustrated with the
spinnaker set. The other craft is a two-mast
lugger with balanced lugs.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a name="fig_151" id="fig_151"></a>
<img src="images/i_199.png" width="200" height="166" alt="Fig. 151" title="" />
</div>

<p>Attention is now directed to "reaching."
For this particular work the yachtsman
should put on a medium rudder. When using
a weighted tiller the weight should be put
in a midway position. The head-sails
should be pulled in fairly tight and the aft-sails
made slack. The yachtsman, however,
should not slacken them as for scudding.
<a href="#fig_151">Fig. 151</a> shows a schooner reaching. The
thick black lines represent the booms of the
sails. If the wind is very light a spinnaker-jib
may be set or a jib-topsail in light or
moderate breezes. In the case of a wind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
that comes over the stern quarter, as indicated
by the arrow <i>A</i>, the next heavier
rudder, or its equivalent in weighted tiller,
should be put in operation, and the sails
slackened out a little more than before.
The boat is then said to be free and sailing
on the starboard tack. If the wind is coming
in the direction <i>B</i> the jib and foresail
may require slackening and the aft sails
pulled in more than when sailing with the
wind in the direction <i>C</i>. A still lighter
rudder can be used as the course gets near
to beating windward, and the yacht is said
to be close-hauled on the starboard tack.</p>

<p>In beating to windward, if a rudder is
used at all, it should be as light as possible,
just heavy enough to keep the boat steady.
However, this is just the condition of sailing
when a boat can dispense with a rudder. It
depends entirely upon the characteristics of
the particular yacht being sailed, and for
this the yachtsman must depend upon his
own experience. The jib-topsail should not
be used in a case like this, and if the wind
is fairly strong a smaller jib should be set
than that used for reaching. It is advisable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to slacken the jib and foresail out and pull
the aft-sails in somewhat tightly. <a href="#fig_152">Fig. 152</a>
shows a cutter beating to windward on a
port tack. In this case she will have to pay
out to starboard a bit before her sails fill.</p>

<p>In sailing the weather must be watched
very closely, and the amount of sail carried
will depend entirely upon the weather conditions.
A yacht should never be overloaded
with sail. If she has more than she
can comfortably carry she will heel over and
drag her sails in the water. Not only this,
but she will also drift to leeward when beating
to windward. When sailing a new boat,
her best trim for various points of sailing
and force of wind must be found by painstaking
experiments. The boat should always
be sailed with her sails as slack as she
will take them and keep in her course. In
this way she will move faster than when the
sails are pulled in close.</p>

<p>The model yachtsman should always
watch the wind and note whether it shifts
its direction or alters its force. The boat
is trimmed accordingly when the boat is put
about. Easing or tightening the jib or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
main-sheet slightly will make a very noticeable
difference.</p>

<p>By taking down the top-sail or setting a
jib-head top-sail in place of a jack yard top-sail,
the yacht will be caused to ride easier
in puffs of wind. In case she does not point
well to windward when beating, the yachtsman
should try a smaller jib, or he can
slacken the foresail-sheet. If she runs off
regularly to leeward on one tack only, while
keeping well to windward on the other, she
has some defect in construction or a bent
keel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>TWO-FOOT SAILING YACHT</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE model yacht described in this Chapter
is the design of Mr. W. J. Daniels,
of England, and was described by him in
"Junior Mechanics." Mr. Daniels is one of
the best known and most successful English
designers of model yachts, and the one here
described can easily be constructed by the
average boy:</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In order that the reader may realize the obstacles
to be surmounted in designing a model yacht that
will sail in a straight line to windward, irrespective
of the different pressure that the wind may expend
on the sails, it must be pointed out that the boat
is continuously altering the shape of the submerged
part of her hull: therefore, unless the hull is so designed
that harmony is retained at every angle to
which the pressure of wind on the sails may heel it,
the model's path through the water will be, more or
less, an arc of a circle. Whether the boat sails toward
the wind, or, in other words, in a curve the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
center of the circle of which is on the same side of
the boat as the wind, or in a curve the center of the
circle of which is on the opposite or leeward side,
will depend upon the formation of the boat.</p>

<p>As these notes are intended to first initiate the
reader into the subject of model yacht building and
construction, the design supplied is one in which all
things, as far as shape is concerned, have been considered.</p>

<p>It is the endeavor of every designer to produce
the most powerful boat possible for a given length&mdash;that
is, one that can hold her sail up in resistance
to the wind-pressure best. Of course, the reader
will easily realize that breadth and weight of keel
will be the main features that will enable the model
to achieve this object; but, as these two factors
are those that tend to make a design less slender, if
pushed to extremes, the designer has to compromise
at a point when the excess of beam and buoyancy
are <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'deterimental'">detrimental</ins> to the speed lines of the
hull.</p>

<p>But the question of design pure and simple is
a complex one, and we do not intend to weary the
reader just now with anything of that kind, so we
will now proceed to build the hull. In order that
we may correctly interpret the shape shown in the
design without being expert woodcarvers, we must
use our ingenuity and by mechanical means achieve
our object, at the same time saving ourselves a
large amount of labor, such as we should have to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
expend if we made this boat from a solid block of
wood.</p>

<p>Now, as regards understanding the drawings: it
is essential to remember that a line which in one
view is a curve is always a straight line in the
other two views. Those lines which are drawn
parallel to the water-line are known as water-lines,
and it will be seen that the curves shown on the
deck plan represent the actual shapes of the hull
at the corresponding water-lines above, below, and
exactly on the load water-line. In other words,
if after the hull is made it were sunk down to these
various levels, the shapes of the hole made in
the surface of the water would be as shown in the
plan.</p>

<p>Therefore, instead of making our boat from a
solid block of wood, we will make our block up
from several layers, the thickness of each layer
being equal to the space between the water-lines;
but before gluing these layers together we will cut
them out to the exact shape that the boat will be
at their various positions.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to have a separate piece
of wood for each layer, as some layers below the
actual water-line will be cut from the pieces of
wood that have been cut out from the layers above.</p>

<p>In this case, the boat being 24 inches long, the
top layer will be the same length and breadth as the
boat, and 1 inch in thickness.</p>

<p>Draw down the center of the board a straight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
line, and other lines square to it, representing the
position of the cross-sections as shown in the drawing.
You have now to transfer the deck line to this
board, and this is done by marking the breadth at
the various sections and drawing a curve through
the spots, a thin strip of straight-grained wood
being used as a rule, the latter being held down
by such weights as are available. For the purpose
of laying off the water-lines truly, lines spaced at
1<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches are shown; the first, it will be noticed, is
half a section or <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch from the stem head.</p>

<p>The material required will be a board of pine
about 6 feet long, 8 inches wide, and 1 inch finished
thickness.</p>

<p>Nearly all wood-yards stock first-quality pine, but
it is in planks 3 inches thick. You can no doubt
pick up a short length about 4 feet long.</p>

<p>If so, take it to a sawmill and have two boards
1<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches thick cut and then machine-planed down
to a dead inch. Perhaps you can purchase a board
that is already cut, and is fully 1 inch thick, to allow
for planing.</p>

<p>Prepare one edge of the board straight with a
plane, seeing that it is square to the surface.</p>

<p>As a planing-machine always leaves a series of
ridges across the board, varying according to the
quality of the machine, it is necessary before transferring
the lines to the wood to just skim the surface
with a nicely sharpened plane, and set so as to
just skim the wood.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The lengths required are: <i>A</i>, plank 24 inches
long; <i>B</i>, plank 24 inches; <i>C</i>, plank 18<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches.</p>

<p>The <i>D</i> plank will be cut from the center of <i>B</i>,
but will have to be shifted two sections forward.</p>

<p>Having transferred the various shapes from the
drawing on to their respective layers, you saw out
each carefully with a bow or a keyhole-saw, care
being taken not to cut inside the lines. It is better
to cut full, and trim down to the lines with a
chisel or plane. A good deal of trouble can be
saved by the expenditure of a few cents for having
them machine-sawed, in which case ask the
sawyer to use his finest-toothed saw.</p>

<p>Having cut out layers <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, and <i>D</i>, fresh lines
are marked, as shown by the dotted lines in the
plan. These indicate the shape of the inside of
each layer when the boat is carved out, and save
labor.</p>

<p>These may as well be sawed out now as carved
out later. It will also facilitate gluing up, as it
will allow the superfluous glue to be squeezed out,
and also decrease the breadth of the joint.</p>

<p>In order to get these various layers glued together
dead true to their positions as indicated in
the design, you must choose a section about amidships,
say section 11, and with a square draw a line
from that section, which is, of course, still showing
on the surface of the layer, down the edge on
either side, joining up with a line across the opposite
face. Also vertical lines at each end of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
midships line must be drawn on the wood, great care
being taken to get the midships line on the under
face of the layers dead opposite each other.</p></div>

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If your outfit contains half a dozen carpenter's
hand screws, these can be used; but if not, it will
be necessary to purchase from a hardware store<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
eight seven-inch bolts and nuts <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch in diameter,
with one washer for each, and to make up four
clamps, as shown in <a href="#fig_156">Fig. 156</a>.</p></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a name="fig_156" id="fig_156"></a>
<img src="images/i_210.png" width="300" height="272" alt="Fig. 156" title="" />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You will start by gluing layer <i>C</i> to layer <i>D</i>, blocks
being placed between the surface of the layers and
the clamps to prevent bruising the wood. These
two are then glued to layer <i>B</i>, and when this is
thoroughly set they are glued to the layer <i>A</i>. The
best glue to use for this job is marine glue, which
does not dry too quickly, and so gives plenty of time
to see that the layers have not shifted. In every
case one clamp should be placed at each extreme end
of the shorter layer, so as to insure the ends making
contact, the other two being placed equidistant.</p>

<p>While waiting for the glue to set, you can be
preparing the four layers (shown below <i>D</i>) for the
lead keel pattern. The lines must be cut out, in
this case, with a chisel, as it will be noticed that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
lower faces must be left wide enough to receive the
top face of the layer beneath it.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the under face of each of
these layers extends beyond the top face aft, and
allowance must be made for this. On laying off
the lines on the fin layers, do not join up with a
point each end, but leave about <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch thickness,
as shown on the drawing.</p>

<p>These layers must be drilled through to take the
keel-bolts, which are made from two motorcycle
spokes, twelve-gage. These should be cut to a
length of 5<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> or 6 inches. Great care should be
taken to insure that the midship lines are exactly
vertical over each other when these layers are glued
up.</p>

<p>Before gluing these four layers on to the hull
proper, they should be held in position by means of
the spokes, in which position they can be sawed to
shape for the keel pattern. First, with a small plane
or sharp chisel cut down roughly, then a rasp and
different grades of sandpaper are used, working
across the joints.</p>

<p>It will be realized that, if the pattern for the
keel were cut off dead on the line indicated on the
design, there would be a loss of wood through the
saw cut. In order to obviate this, another line
<span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> inch below the proper lead line is drawn, and
the saw cut made between these two lines. You
will now plane down each face that is left rough by
the saw, straight and square to each of these lines.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
On the top face of the pattern for the lead, glue
or tack a piece <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> inch thick along the face, and
cut down the edges flush.</p>

<p>You will by this means have made up for the
amount of wood carried away by the saw. You
will no doubt find a difficulty in holding the pieces
of wood for planing in the ordinary way, but it is
simple enough if you set the plane nicely, grip it in
a vise or bench screw upside down, and push the
work over the plane's face, instead of vice versa.
But be careful of your fingers!</p>

<p>Take the pieces left from the spokes when cutting
down to length, and put these in the holes in
the keel pattern. These are for cores, and if you
take your pattern to a foundry they will cast it for
a small amount, with the holes in it.</p>

<p>Shoot the top face of the lead in the manner before
described, and fit on. The hull is now ready
for carving out. Screw on your bench two pieces
of wood about 18 inches in length and 4 inches wide,
so that they project over the edge of the bench
about 10 inches. These should be about 15 inches
apart. Place your hull upside down on them, and
fix it by nailing upward into the top layer. After
cutting off the corners of the layers roughly with
a chisel you use a small plane set fairly fine, and
work all over the hull evenly, taking care not to
cut below any of the joints. A small gouge will
be required to clear the wood from the region of
the after fin, a round rasp&mdash;sandpaper being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
wrapped around a small stick&mdash;being used for
smoothing down afterward.</p>

<p>Templates of the cross-sections should now be
made from thick white paper. This is done by
pricking through the design to transfer their shape
onto the paper. The cross-sections have on this
account been produced here actual size. If cross-lines
representing the water-lines are drawn, you
will have an excellent guide for fitting, as these
lines will, of course, come opposite each glued joint.</p>

<p>Try your templates now and again as you work,
and do not try to finish one spot, but keep the
whole at an even stage, and you will see the hull
gradually grow into shape.</p>

<p>The topsides (which is the name given to that
part of the vessel's hull above the water-line) are
responsible for the boat's appearance when afloat,
and until the top sheer is cut off the boat looks very
disappointing. The cross-lines being still on the
upper layer, draw square lines from them down
the topsides and from the drawing mark the points
through which the sheer-line runs. The thickness
of the deck must be allowed for, and as this will
be just over <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> inch, the line must be drawn this
much below the finished sheer-line. The arch of
the transom must be marked, and the hull cut down
to the sheer. To avoid the risk of splitting, a number
of fine saw cuts are made down each section line
and two or three at the transom.</p>

<p>You now proceed to carve out the inside. Pad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
your bench bearers and rest your hull upon them.
A curved wood gouge with a fairly flat edge is the
best tool. Get it nicely sharpened, and work all
over the inside of hull until it is about <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> inch thick,
the top edge being left <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch wide.</p>

<p>Keep holding up to the light until it is showing
a blood-red color, and smooth down the gouge marks
with coarse sandpaper.</p>

<p>The hole for the stern-tube must now be drilled,
and the tube made and fitted. The hole should be
<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch in diameter. First drill a smaller hole, and
then with a <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>-inch rat-tail file slowly open it out,
at the same time rubbing a groove down the stern-post.
The stern-tube is made from a piece of light-gage
brass tube, it being cut away with a piercing
saw to leave a strip the length of the stern-post.
Drill three holes in the strip at equal distance and
large enough to take a <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch brass screw, No. 0
size. Temporarily screw the tube in position, and
from a piece of thin brass make a plate for the inside.
An oval hole will have to be made in the
plate to enable it to seat flat over the tube. Solder
this while in position. Then remove the whole, and
replace, after white-leading where wood touches
brass.</p>

<p>The deck-beams, three in number and <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch
square in section, must now be fitted. The sheer
edge which we left <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch wide must be recessed
to receive the beams, the recess being made with
a <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>-inch chisel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Before gluing beams in, three coats of good varnish
must be applied to the inside of shell.</p>

<p>The deck should now be prepared and fitted.
You will require a piece of pine of ample length
and breadth, <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch in thickness, and after planing
finely and sand-papering, pieces of the same stuff
should be glued on the under face to reinforce it
where the bowsprit, keel-plate, hatch rim, and mast
will be fitted. Cut these pieces to shape before
gluing on.</p>

<p>Before doing the latter, apply a coat of clear
size to the upper face of the deck; this will bring
up the grain, so paper it down when dry. This
process should be repeated three times.</p>

<p>Three coats of varnish should be given to the
under side of the deck after the pieces have been
glued on, and when dry the deck can be fitted,
<span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch veneer pins being used for fixing on, and care
being taken to get it true to position. A center line
is drawn down the under side of the deck, and
marks made to correspond at the stern and transom
on the shell.</p>

<p>The planking lines on the deck can be drawn to
suit your fancy, India ink and a draftsman's ruling
pen being used to do it, afterward applying two
coats of carriage varnish.</p>

<p>To paint the hull, white lead and dryers, in the
proportion of 5 to 1 by weight respectively, should
be dissolved in turpentine, a few drops of linseed
oil being mixed to make it work freely. Have this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
about the consistency of milk, and, after straining,
give the hull about eight coats, one every twenty-four
hours, rubbing each down when dry with No.
00 sandpaper. Keep the joint representing the load
water-line always in sight by penciling over after
each coat of paint is dry. When a sufficient body
of paint has been applied, the colors can be applied.
Enamel is best for this. Stick strips of gummed
paper around the hull at the water-line, and paint
up to the edge. When the paint is dry the paper
can be soaked off, the paper being again applied,
but reversed for the other color. If you can use a
lining brush the paper is not necessary for the
second color.</p>

<p>While the painting is going on, spars, sails, and
fittings can be made. As the spars have to be varnished,
it is best to make them first. Pine should
be used, and after cutting strips of suitable length
and diameter, plane them square in section. With
the batten draw on the face the amount of taper
to be given, and plane down to this line, still keeping
the spar square in section. This having been
done, the corners are planed off carefully until the
spar is octagonal in section, when it is easy to make
it perfectly round with sandpaper by rubbing with
the paper rolled around the stick. The diameter of
our mast is <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch parallel until the hoist of the
fore triangle is reached, tapering from there to <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>
inch at the masthead or truck. The boom is <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span>
inch at the gooseneck, thickening to <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the main-sheet is attached, down to <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch at the
outboard end. The jib-boom is slightly less than
<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch parallel.</p>

<p>All spars should be treated with clear size and
fine sandpaper before varnishing. This will prevent
discoloring by the latter, and will also allow
the India ink markings to be made, which latter
will be a guide for the trimming of the sails.</p>

<p>In order that any yacht, model or otherwise, may
be able to perform her best, it is essential that she
should have well setting sails. In fact, in a model
a badly setting sail will sometimes even be enough
to prevent her going to windward at all. By well
setting sails we mean sails that are naturally flat and
not made so by straining them out on the spars.
Light material, such as cambric or light union silk,
is best for this purpose, but not a material that has
any dressing in it.</p>

<p>This particular sail plan is very easy to mark out.
Lay your material out on a table or smooth surface
and pin it down with drawing-pins, sufficiently
stretching it so as to pull out any creases. The
length of the back edge of the mainsail (which is
called the leech) is measured off 1<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inches inside the
edge of the cloth, and a curve struck as illustrated.
The other two sides of the mainsail are then laid
off and pencil lines drawn. You will note that allowance
must be made for hemming the back edge
of the mainsail. If your sewing-machine has a
hemmer, find out how wide a hem it makes (the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
smaller the better), and make allowance accordingly,
twice the width of the hem being necessary.
Much depends upon the tension at which the machine
is set, so be careful that the latter is sufficiently
slack so that it does not draw up the material.</p>

<p>The jib is marked out in the same manner, and,
as illustrated, the lines representing the positions
of the batten sleeves are drawn. The batten sleeves
are small pockets into which thin pieces of cane
(called battens) are inserted to help the sail to set
nicely. Unless the sail is a good cut to begin with,
however, the insertion of these battens will never
make it right. The sails should now be cut out
with a sharp penknife or scissors, care being taken
not to pull the cloth, and especially not along the
edges that run across the threads. You then hem
the backs and also the foot of the jib. The batten
sleeves (which should be of white satin ribbon about
<span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch in width) should now be sewn on by stitching
down along the extreme edge to the line drawn,
and then down the other edge, the ends being left
open. A strip of narrow tape is sewn across the
foot of the jib-sail to take the strain of the pull,
the part of the jib contained by the curve of the
foot and the tape being known as the bonnet of
the jib.</p>

<p>To prevent the edges of the sails (other than
those hemmed) being stretched, you bind them with
good tape. The tape is first folded and creased by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
rubbing over an edge. The end of the tape is then
turned in. Take a corner of the sail and place it
inside the fold of the tape, care being taken to get
the raw edge right up against the crease. The
needle of the machine should then be lowered
through it as near to the edge of the tape as practicable,
taking care that it goes through both edges.
Keeping a slight pull on the binding, arrange the
cloth in it without pulling the edge. Put the foot
of the machine down and sew it, afterward raising
the foot again and proceeding as before right
around the raw edges of the sail, leaving the needle
down each time the foot is raised. Do not sew
where a batten sleeve passes under the binding, as
you will require the former left open to allow the
batten to pass into the fold of the binding. The
rings for putting up the luffs of the jib- and main-sail
are made by winding a piece of thin brass or
German silver wire around a steel rod (the spokes
used in the keel being suitable for the latter) and
sawing down to divide them. A small eyelet should
be put in each corner of the sails, and others spaced
evenly at about 2<span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches apart along the boom
and about 5 inches apart along the mast, for lacing
on. An extra row of stitching may be run
down the outer edge of the binding to smooth it
down.</p>

<p>The simpler the fittings of a model that is required
for practical sailing, the better. They should
be as light as practical. Aluminum is not advisable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
for fittings when the boat is to be sailed in salt
water.</p></div>

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The bowsprit fittings, which are known as the
gammon iron and heel plate (<a href="#fig_157">Figs. 157</a>, <a href="#fig_158">158</a>), are
made by soldering pieces of brass tube (cut to suitable
size and shape) onto pieces of triangular sheet
brass, as illustrated. The horses can either be of
wire with the ends turned to suitable shape and
fitted with one screw, or they can have plates for
two screws, in which case the wire is either threaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and screwed into the plate or silver-soldered to it.
Silver-soldering is done with a blow-pipe. The flux
used is borax made into a thin paste with water.
Silver-solder is bought in small sheets, and a few
cents' worth will go a long way if used properly.
Cut small pieces about <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> inch by <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> inch, and, after
painting the part to be soldered with your paste
borax with a very small brush, pick up the solder
with the tip of the brush and put it in position. It
will then run around the joint when the metal is
raised to sufficient heat.</p></div>

<img src="images/i_221.png" width="210" height="300" alt="Fig. 158" title="" />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The hatch-rim is made by cutting a strip of thin
brass <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch in width, the length being the circumference
of the oval. The two ends are brought together
and silver-soldered. Cut out the oval in a
piece of very thin brass and fit in your oval strip
so that the flat is just in the center of it. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
can then be sweated around with an ordinary
soldering-iron, the flat being trimmed down afterward
with the shears to leave a flange <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch in
width, the latter being drilled to take <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> inch No. 0
round-head screws.</p></div>

</div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>The deck fitting for the mast, (Fig. 159) is made
in much the same way, a piece of tube being used
instead of cutting a strip of brass. To receive the
heel of the mast a fitting known as the mast-step
must be made and fitted. This, of course, must be
done before the deck is put on. The step is made
from two pieces of brass, each about <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>32</sub></span> inch in
thickness, 1 inch long and <span class='frac'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inch wide. One is
hard-soldered on edge down the center of the
other to form something like a T girder. A slot,
as illustrated, is cut in the upright piece with a
ward file, and holes drilled in the flat for screwing
down on the inside of the boat. A ferrule of
brass tube is fitted to the heel of the mast, a cut of
suitable size being made in it to receive the upright<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of the step. A hole should be drilled through the
heel of the mast at right angles to the slot, and a
wire passed through and riveted, the latter being
of suitable thickness to be received by the slot in
the step.</p></div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 220px;"><a name="fig_162" id="fig_162"></a><a name="fig_163" id="fig_163"></a><a name="fig_164" id="fig_164"></a>
<img src="images/i_223.png" width="220" height="300" alt="Fig. 164" title="" />
</div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>The rudder-blade (Fig. 162) is made from a piece
of sheet brass fitted to a tube, the latter being an
easy fit into the stern-tube already fitted. The
blade can be soldered onto the tube. The pintle
on which the rudder fits and swings is a strip of
brass, the width of the after fin, a wire pin being
hard-soldered in to fit up into the rudder.</p>

<p>The pintle (Fig. 163) should be fitted before
the painting is started.</p>

<p>In the steering gear, instead of a quadrant, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the fitting on the rudder-head of the "Braine"
gear is called, you fit an ordinary tiller (Fig. 164)
by bending a wire to suit your fancy and soldering
it on to a collar made from a piece of tube that
will just sleeve on the outside of the rubber-tube,
which latter is fixed by drilling a hole right through
it and the rudder head, and fitting a tapered pin.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a name="fig_165" id="fig_165"></a>
<img src="images/i_224a.png" width="300" height="67" alt="Fig. 165" title="" />
</div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>The steering-gear rack (Fig. 165) by which the
amount of helm is adjusted is made from a strip
of brass cut with lugs which are bent up at right
angles as illustrated. This need only be of thin
sheet metal, as the strain is very small.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig_166" id="fig_166"></a>
<img src="images/i_224b.png" width="400" height="348" alt="Fig. 166" title="" />
</div>

<p>For running before the wind, separate lines are
used, two in number, as illustrated, and the amount
of helm is governed by the distance away from
midships that the lead is moved. For instance, if
the lead is placed amidships, the pull will simply
keep the rudder dead straight, whereas if placed on
the deck edge it will allow the maximum amount
of angle.</p>

<p>Your bowsers can be made from pieces of toothbrush
handle or from brass or German-silver wire.
Very efficient bowsers can be made from aluminum
tube cut in sections about <span class='frac'><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> inch long, with three
holes drilled in each piece around its periphery.</p>

<p>Plaited bobbin cotton should be used for the
cordage, as it does not curl up when wet.</p>

<p>If you decide to fit the Braine steering gear, a
spur or bumpkin, as it is termed, must be fitted to
take the rubber centering line.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
